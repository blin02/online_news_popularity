"56bca103b05f9d1982000625","Lance Ulanoff","Tech","Relax. Twitter's new Timeline algorithm is pretty tame.

Nearly 24 hours after Twitter first announced a new Twitter Timeline option to load ""Best Tweets First"" on your Twitter timeline, followed by your regular reverse-chronological tweet stream, the option finally started showing up early Thursday morning on desktop (Web) and mobile.

I'd been checking my Twitter desktop settings on and off all day yesterday and did it first thing this morning at 5:30 a.m. ET. There it was. I also checked with co-workers in London who, interestingly, still didn't have it. While the rollout is supposed to be global, some regions are probably being greenlit before others.

Nestled under the ""Content"" section of ""Account Settings"" is a new Timeline field with a simple check box next to ""Show me the best Tweets first: Tweets you are likely to care about most will show up first in your timeline."" There's also a link to ""Learn more."" Suffice it to say that Twitter's mostly secret algorithm is looking at those you follow and how you follow and engage with them and their tweets.

Before I enabled the feature, I shared an image of the option with my followers. When I did, I noticed Twitter had placed a huge box at the top of my timeline promoting the new feature.  It also introduced a tiny bit of new language: “Tweets about topics and people you care about most will now show up at the top of your timeline.”

The “topics” portion is new and a bit confusing since the new Timeline is supposed to be based solely on those you follow. I guess the algorithm is also gleaning interests from that. It wasn't clear if enabling the feature will introduce tweets (and retweets) from those you don’t follow.

The only way I’d know for sure, is to try it. So I turned on the feature.

When I checked my iPhone 6 Twitter app, where the option is a little more buried (it's under Settings/Account/[Account Name]/Timeline Personalization) I found that the option was already turned on. So yes, it's a universal account setting and if you turn it off on mobile, it also turns off on the desktop.

Best tweets in practice

I logged out of Twitter and then logged in for what, I hoped, would be an opportunity to see the maximum impact of what most longtime Twitter users consider a major change. 

There wasn't much of a difference. I could see a couple of tweets near the top that appeared to be retweeted hours ago from accounts that I follow, but they did not seem like the ""best tweets."" I logged out and then back in again. Now I was seeing all fresh tweets (seconds old, at most). 

I wondered if I follow too many people (over 7,000) for Twitter's new timeline algorithm to be effective.

I logged into a second account I maintain and enabled the feature. That account follows only 17 other accounts. The first time I looked, I saw a promoted tweet at the top -- as Twitter promised. Advertising would, with the new timeline, work pretty much the way it always had. When I logged in again, I got all fresh tweets.

The experience on mobile was exactly the same.

The only time I actually saw the new ""best tweets"" section was when I first opened Twitter (after enabling the feature). Twitter power users like me, those who tweet at a high volume and are constantly checking their Twitter feeds, will probably not notice much of a difference when they enable this feature. 

It could, though, be especially powerful for those who only occasionally check their feeds, since quality content will now be front-loaded, making the service seem more valuable for those who don't quite get it.

Throughout Thursday, millions of Twitter users will gain access to the new Twitter timelines best-tweets-first feature. Share your experiences in the comments below. Or tweet to me at @LanceUlanoff.

Even though Netflix doesn't report ratings, the series premiered to much critical acclaim, solidified Ansari's post-Parks and Rec career and was considered a lock for renewal. In fact, we're surprised it took this long. 

Ansari tweeted out word of the renewal Thursday afternoon:

The good news comes just a few weeks after Netflix renewed freshman Marvel hit Jessica Jones and several others during the Television Critics Association awards. At the time, it was expected that Master of None would pick up a new season order as well, but CEO Ted Sarandos only hinted that good news for the series was on the way.

Ansari, meanwhile, oversaw a panel about his show and spoke about Season 2 with confidence, even if it wasn't official at the time. 

""Season 2, you know, I think we’re figuring it out,"" he said. ""I definitely need some time to refill my head with the first season was so personal, and I just want to make sure that whatever we do for Season 2 lives up to what we made in the first season. And I really had such a great experience partnering with Netflix and working with this whole group of people. So, yeah, we’d love to do it, and we’re figuring it out."" 

The show is expected to return in 2017, per Ansari.

Sydney producer, Tom Budin, smashed together an EDM track to mourn the death of Sydney, Australia's nightlife and give us all some joy in what has been our darkest days and most rested nights.

The New South Wales state government and its leader Mike Baird, has been in an ongoing battle with the youth of Sydney over strict laws, which has seen punters locked out of clubs at 1:30 a.m., last drinks called at 3 a.m. and civilised wine drinkers not allowed to buy a bottle to take home after 10 p.m.

The city's lockout laws have become a point of fierce debate during the last few weeks, after a long period of slowly bubbling outrage. The recent anger followed an epic 8,000 essay by businessman Matt Barrie.

Budin's deep-base tune with a siren backing, appropriately titled ""Mike Baird,"" has some stellar lyrics directed right at the ringer of the death knell. It will serve as a perfect backdrop to the Keep Sydney Open rally this Sunday, which looks set to atrract at least 10,000 attendees, according to its Facebook event page.

Not-to-miss killer lines from the track:

""Forever locked out, won't let me in.""
""Won't let me past, I'm blocked out.""
""Mike, Mike Baird. Mike, Mike Baird. Mike, Mike Baird.""
""Empty Streets.""

"56c1b25397b2f8124b0012d2","Tim Chester","Watercooler","LONDON -- A clever Reddit user has created one of the greatest DIY Harry Potter projects ever: A fully functional, digital recreation of the Weasley family's clock.

The timepiece, which is housed in the shell of an old antique clock and stuffed full of wires and LEDs, was created by user tbornottb3. It communicates with the family's smartphones to periodically update on their location.

See also: Rupert Grint betrays Ron Weasley, says he didn't enjoy kissing Emma Watson in 'Harry Potter'

The Weasley's clock stood in their living room at The Burrow and featured nine hands, one for each member of the household. Instead of telling the time, it pointed to various locations pinpointing members of the family, including home, school, work, travelling, lost, hospital, prison and mortal peril.

The options on the replica clock's dial meanwhile are home, work, holiday, forest, on the way, and - of course - mortal peril. What triggers the latter? ""Whatever each person wanted,"" the creator explains. ""For example, my sister has it triggered by a forecast of too-cold weather, and I have it triggered by the radius of our rival school.""

The clock was built between Thanksgiving and Christmas last year, and unveiled online Sunday. The project began with the shell of a broken old clock from an antique store.

Then plans were mapped out on a scrap of paper and given to a friend who translated it all onto Adobe Illustrator.

The creators then ""laser cut / etched those vectors onto wood."" Another photo shows the inside workings of the clock. A Particle Photon connects via a breadboard to an addressable LED strip, its creator says.

There was a fair amount of coding involved.

The system uses the If This Then That (IFTTT) web service, that allows users to connect different applications via a chain of conditional statements called recipes. 

""I used IFTTT to define radii that would send messages to the Photon if my phone entered or exited them,"" the creator explains. All six family members follow the same process. 

""Most of the rules are location-based (setting me to WORK if I enter my university library, HOME if I enter my dorm), but you can set other triggers too (set me to HOLIDAY if the forecast calls for snow, set me to MORTAL PERIL if the stock of the company I'll be working for next year drops too low).""

This is the view from the back of the clock:

And the finished product:

The big letter 'B' is lit by the bottom of the LED strand and illuminates a different colour for each member of the family as the clock is about to update their position.

Fingers crossed someone at Warner Bros commissions this for mass production.

"56bac174b589e412180001fd","The Associated Press","World","A lawsuit filed by a group of women alleges that the University of Tennessee has violated Title IX regulations and created a ""hostile sexual environment"" through a policy of indifference toward assaults by student-athletes.

The federal suit filed Tuesday in Nashville states Tennessee's policies made students more vulnerable to sexual assault and says that the school had a ""clearly unreasonable response"" after incidents that caused the women making complaints to endure additional harassment. The suit also states the university interfered with the disciplinary process to favor male athletes.

There have been several sexual assault complaints made against Tennessee student-athletes over the last four years, including former football players A.J. Johnson, Michael Williams, and Riyahd Jones. They were indicted on aggravated rape charges in February 2015 and have separate trial dates this summer.

Rumors have already begun circulating that the lawsuit will impact the football team.

Reports are circulating that Tennessee may be faced with a bowl ban in response to the Title IX lawsuit.— Jimmy Hyams (@jimbohyams) February 10, 2016

Additional student athletes named in the lawsuit include former basketball player Yemi Makanjuola and an unnamed current football player. 

The suit was filed by David Randolph Smith, a lawyer representing six unidentified plaintiffs, against the University of Tennessee and the director of the office of student conduct and community standards. No individual were named as defendants in the complaint.

The suit also states that Tim Rogers, a former vice chancellor for student life, stepped down in 2013 ""in protest over the violation of Title IX and the UT administration's and athletic department's deliberate indifference to the clear and present danger of sexual assaults by UT athletes.""

Bill Ramsey, a lawyer representing the school, said in a statement the university ""acted lawfully and in good faith"" in the situations outlined in the complaint. Ramsey said the school ""has devoted significant time and energy to provide a safe environment for our students, to educate and raise awareness about sexual assault and to encourage students to come forward and report sexual assault.""

The Tennessean first reported the lawsuit.

This suit comes two weeks after Florida State settled a Title IX lawsuit with a former student Erica Kinsman, who said the school failed to adequately investigate allegations that she was raped by former Seminoles quarterback Jameis Winston. The Heisman winner and No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft has said the allegations are false and that he and Kinsman had consensual sex. No charges were ever filed against Winston as prosecutors said there wasn't enough evidence to win a conviction and that there were gaps in Kinsman's story.

Title IX is a federal statute that bans discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. The U.S. Department of Education in 2011 warned schools of their legal responsibilities to immediately investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if the criminal investigation has not concluded.

The World Food Programme called it a ""milestone"" in the evolution of its food assistance program.SEE ALSO: Here's how you can help during the refugee crisis in EuropeThe system, though new to the World Food Programme, is not new to refugees in their relationship with the U.N. Similar technology is already used when refugees register with the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR), using their unique irises as a sort of fingerprint to store identification information in a database.King Abdullah Park's iris-scanning machines simply pull this information from the database, deducting payment from a monthly food allowance once a refugee's identity is confirmed.          The new system makes the process of buying groceries more efficient for refugee populations, providing greater safety and security than electronic payment cards, which can easily be lost, stolen or misused.“We are really capitalizing on technology that already exists,” Dina El-Kassaby, regional communications officer for the World Food Programme, told Mashable. “We are just giving this technology a retail spin.”""Refugees are moving all the time ... We knew we could take it to the next level.""For refugees shopping for groceries, the new process simply means going to a store counter, scanning their items through checkout and looking into a machine to pay. There are no cards, cash or vouchers needed -- which is essential for a population that often struggles to maintain a static location.“Refugees are moving all the time,” El-Kassaby said. “They are coming in and out of different countries. Having a physical thing like electronic payment cards is sometimes difficult, though the technology is very effective and has worked very well. We knew we could take it to the next level.”At the onset of the refugee crisis, the World Food Programme solely provided aid in the form of hot meals distributed daily through relief check points in Jordan. As the crisis grew, refugees were given more autonomy over their food selections with an electronic payment card, refilled monthly with a food stipend for a more sustainable form of ongoing assistance.While the electronic cards have been the standard for several years, they aren't always practical -- especially when it comes to safety and security.“Sometimes, just like anyone, refugees would forget their PIN numbers or misplace their cards,” El-Kassaby said. “Or they would leave the country and leave the card behind. In some cases, cards would be stolen or misused. This iris scan technology just cuts all that out.”There are more than 650,000 refugees living in Jordan, with most coming to the country from Syria. Of those refugees, 20% are living in refugee camps -- populations that are most in need of reliable food assistance. Though the new technology is currently only operating in King Abdullah Park, where about 1,000 refugees live, El-Kassaby said she expects the program to expand across Jordan and other countries with high refugee populations in the coming months.Have something to add to this story?

"56c4e7a3b05f9d6e71000036","The Associated Press","World","Concealed handguns will be allowed in University of Texas classrooms but generally banned from dorms under rules begrudgingly approved Wednesday by the school's president, whose hand was forced by a new state law.

Like many who study or work at the school in liberal Austin, President Greg Fenves opposes allowing guns on the roughly 50,000-student campus. Texas' universities had been gun-free zones under the state's previous concealed handgun laws, but the Republican-dominated Legislature voted last year to force public universities to allow license holders to bring their guns to campus starting Aug. 1.

""I do not believe handguns belong on a university campus, so this decision has been the greatest challenge of my presidency to date,"" Fenves said in announcing his decision to adopt rules recommended by a campus study group in December.

Gun-rights activists insist the right to have weapons on campus falls under the Second Amendment and they call it a critical self-defense measure.

However, the so-called ""campus carry"" measure has met with fierce resistance from students, faculty and other staff, including University of Texas System Chancellor William McRaven, the former head of U.S. Special Operations Command who directed the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden.

""The presence of handguns at an institution of higher learning is contrary to our mission of education and research, which is based on inquiry, free speech, and debate,"" Fenves wrote in a letter to McRaven.

Private schools are allowed to keep banning weapons and Fenves noted most have opted to do so, including Baylor, Rice, Southern Methodist and Texas Christian universities, the largest and most influential private schools in the state.

See also: Hero organizes mass farting protest in response to gun rights demonstration

State lawmakers allowed public universities to carve out some gun-free zones as long as it didn't result in a campus-wide ban. Fenves said a blanket ban on guns in classrooms would have violated the law.

In most cases, a person must be 21 years old to get a gun license in Texas, which trims the gun-carrying student population a bit. And while licensed students will be allowed to bring their handguns to class, they won't be able to do so openly. A separate law that allows the open carry of handguns doesn't apply to college campuses.

Critics have predicted that allowing guns on campus will make it harder for schools to recruit top students and faculty. Gun-Free UT, a group of students, faculty and staff, has said allowing guns in classrooms will create a threatening atmosphere and chill free speech in academics. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg has said he will put into his syllabus that his class is not open to students carrying guns.

More than 1,700 other UT Austin professors have signed a petition opposing guns in classrooms. In October, former UT Austin professor Daniel Hamermesh resigned, citing concern that the measure may increase the “risk that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom.”

The ""campus carry"" measure has prompted highly visible protests on both sides of the issue for months. In December, pro-gun activists equipped with legal AK-47s and fake blood staged a mock mass shooting in support of the measure near the UT Austin campus. The event was counter-protested by dozens of students who staged a ""mass farting"" protest and wielded dildos. 

The December protest was inspired by Campus (DILDO) Carry, which is scheduled for the first day of school after the measure goes into effect in August, and aims to highlight the fact that, under university guidelines, students would be able to bring guns into classrooms but not dildos. 

""Starting on the first day of Long Session classes on August 24, 2016, we are strapping gigantic swinging dildos to our backpacks in protest of campus carry,"" the event's organizer, Jessica Jin, wrote on the Facebook event page. ""Just about as effective at protecting us from sociopathic shooters, but much safer for recreational play.""

More than 10,000 people are scheduled to attend Campus (DILDO) Carry, which has gained steam on social media using the hashtag #CocksNotGlocks.

If approved, the campus carry measure would have some other exceptions.

Certain laboratories will remain gun-free, as will areas or events that involve school-age children. State law still prohibits weapons at sporting events.

Family members who are licensed to carry can keep their weapons when visiting students. University staff members who are licensed to carry may also hold onto their weapons if they must enter a dorm.

The rules now go to the University of Texas System Regents for review. If no changes are made within 90 days, the rules will be final.

"56ba3375b589e4592000004e","Rajat Agrawal","Tech","It's hard to remember, but things looked good for Facebook's ambitions in India last fall.

""India has 600,000 villages, and most people get scared when they hear this number. My vision is to connect them all with optical fiber cable in the next five years,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during a town hall with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, in September 2015.

Zuckerberg had begun the session by reciting India's importance in the history of Facebook. He said he was once unsure about his company's future, and his mentor, Steve Jobs, suggested he visit a temple in India, where he would find his answers, which Zuckerberg did. The revelation instantly struck a chord, not only with the prime minister, but also with many Indians watching the session online.

Cut to three months later and Facebook has somehow managed to become an enemy of the very same people Zuckerberg was trying to connect with. Much ink has been spilled on Facebook's Free Basics program and how it violates the tenets of net neutrality. Mashable has extensively covered the tussle between Facebook and India's telecom regulator, which finally culminated yesterday with India banning Free Basics along with other zero rated services.

It's fascinating how Facebook could stumble so badly when it came to one of its boldest bets in its mission to connect the unconnected population in the world. 

Let's begin with some numbers. Industry estimates suggest India had 375 million Internet users at the end of October 2015, a number that was supposed to touch 402 million. Facebook has over 130 million users from India that log in at least once every month, which translates to roughly one in three connected Indians who access Facebook. If you throw in the more than 100 million monthly active users WhatsApp has in India, the number of users of Facebook-owned services is even higher -- assuming there are many people who use WhatsApp but don't have a Facebook account.

With Free Basics, Facebook said it wanted to bring more unconnected users online. At a town hall held at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi last December, Zuckerberg said Free Basics had already brought 15 million users online, of which a million came from India. And that's not all -- he claimed half of people who came to Free Basics opted to pay to access the whole Internet.

Basically not doing its job

What was missing from the announcement was the number of people who accessed Free Basics that were not exactly first-time Internet users. A Buzzfeed investigation revealed that in most markets where Facebook had launched Free Basics with carrier partners, the majority of users already had a data plan and used Free Basics to access Facebook for free or used it when they ran out of data credit.

In other words, Facebook's carrier partners were using Free Basics to retain customers by helping them access Facebook for free, while subscribers on other networks had to pay for it. No wonder carriers were willing to foot the cost of serving Free Basics.

""The biggest reason why four billion people don’t access the Internet -- bigger than issues of access or cost -- is they don’t know why it might be valuable,"" Zuckerberg had proclaimed in his IIT Delhi town hall. That proclamation might have some truth to it, but in India's case access and cost might be bigger issues. Which takes us back to where I started -- Prime Minister Modi's ambition to connect 600,000 Indian villages with optical fiber cable.

According to the latest report available with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the same body that banned Free Basics), India had a total of 131.49 million ""broadband"" connections at the end of Nov. 2015. (TRAI classifies any connection above 512kbps as broadband -- this includes wired connections, wireless as well as fixed wireless connections like Wi-Fi, WiMax and VSAT.)

That's 131.49 million connections for a population of over 1.25 billion -- only about 10% of the country. What India needs is more connectivity.

Technologist Anil Dash told Zuckerberg why Free Basics is probably the wrong approach for Facebook in India: ""Internet.org may be a fundamentally wrong structure for delivering these kinds of services because it doesn't empower people to create solutions for themselves that are culturally and contextually appropriate. What about pausing the Internet Basics effort and spending some time on a real effort to listen to Indian voices about what would help them have connectivity on their own terms, in a way they find acceptable?"" he commented on Zuckerberg's Facebook post on being disappointed with India's decision.

The point being that rather than giving unlimited access to a restricted Internet, Facebook could have served India better by giving limited, free access to the entire Internet. Surprisingly, Facebook is working on a project in India, called Express Wi-Fi, where it is encouraging local entrepreneurs to purchase inexpensive hardware to setup a public Wi-Fi network and provide affordable Internet service. Guess how many people know about this project? Certainly not the millions of Indians who came to know about Free Basics via Facebook's multi-million dollar advertising blitzkrieg.

How Google is picking up Facebook's dropped ball

India's telecom minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, has set a target of adding another 100 million Internet users in the country over the next seven months. To achieve this figure, the state-run carrier BSNL will be setting up 2,500 public Wi-Fi hotspots across the country by Mar. 2017. Facebook could have played a big role in this mission, but it lost its way somewhere.

After addressing the town hall session at Facebook's headquarters, Prime Minister Modi visited the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, where India-born Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a partnership with Indian Railways to install 400 Wi-Fi hotspots at the busiest railway stations -- 100 of which would go online in 2016.

""Even with just the first 100 stations online, this project will make Wi-Fi available for the more than 10 million people who pass through every day. This will rank it as the largest public Wi-Fi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users,"" Pichai wrote in a blog post announcing the partnership. 

""It will also be fast -- many times faster than what most people in India have access to today, allowing travelers to stream a high-definition video while they’re waiting, research their destination, or download some videos, a book or a new game for the journey ahead. Best of all, the service will be free to start, with the long-term goal of making it self-sustainable to allow for expansion to more stations and other places, with RailTel and more partners, in the future,"" he added.

Google's Wi-Fi project, which has largely been welcomed, shows why Free Basics was flawed from the start: While Facebook was peddling a limited Internet where users could access its services along with others that Facebook chose, Google was giving away the entire Internet, and at speeds faster than then norm.

It's still an open question whether Google's project will succeed in the long term, but at least it's an attempt to address the key issue of connectivity, and with a level of service that most of the world enjoys. In contrast, Facebook's Free Basics was treating India as the third world. Indians have had quite enough of that, thank you.

"56cb6ed8b05f9d274f0000fa","Seth Fiegerman","Business","Matt Mellen was only one mile from his home in Kalamazoo, Michigan on Saturday afternoon when his Uber driver, Jason, received a phone call and reportedly became very erratic, ""running stop signs"" and ""driving through medians"" before finally letting him out.Eight hours later, another passenger named Derek unknowingly hailed a ride from the same driver and jokingly asked Jason if he was the drive-by shooter police were searching for that night. Jason, apparently more sedated by this point, calmly replied, ""No....No, I'm just tired."" He was arrested shortly after.We are horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence in Kalamazoo. Statement from our Chief Security Officer: https://t.co/jWr57KY49W— Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2016
In between those two memorable rides, the Uber driver, Jason Dalton allegedly opened fire on individuals at a Kia car dealership, a Cracker Barrel and a set of townhouses spread across the city of Kalamazoo, killing six and injuring more.The shooting rampage quickly upended a community and re-ignited the country's all too frequent political debate around gun safety measures. But the revelation of the alleged shooter's involvement with Uber adds a new chilling dimension that once again casts a spotlight on what is supposed to be cornerstone of the $62.5 billion startup's business: safety.The alleged shooter had a user rating of 4.73 prior to Saturday, a strong rating by Uber's five-star standard. However, he had worked with Uber for just under one month and delivered more than 100 rides.""Before the day in question, this driver had a rating of 4.73 and generally speaking had received very favorable feedback from customers who had ridden with him,"" Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, said on a conference call with reporters on Monday.In an interview with Mashable earlier on Monday, the startup's safety commission said there was nothing it could have done to prevent the alleged shooter from opening fire.""As I understand it, it's a situation of someone who had no criminal background, someone who has been described by police as an average joe — a husband and a father. I can’t see that there was anything that we could have done to prevent this,"" says Ed Davis, a member of Uber's Safety Advisory Board and the former Boston police commissioner.SEE ALSO: Kalamazoo shooting suspect was an Uber driver who took fares during rampage, local police sayIn recent months, multiple Uber drivers have been accused of raping passengers and breaking into at least one customer's home. Some passengers, in turn, have also been caught attacking their Uber drivers. These terrible incidents, which have raised red flags about Uber's background check process, pale in comparison to the horror of this weekend's mass shooting. All that stopped the shooter from turning his gun on Uber passengers in addition to those outside the vehicle was the whims of an unstable driver, rather than some successful protection provided by Uber.The safety danceUber relies on third-party services to handle background checks, cross-referencing drivers' social security numbers, vehicle registrations and licenses against court records and criminal registries. The startup, eager to get drivers on the road as quickly as possible in order to fuel its breakneck global expansion plans, has repeatedly pushed back against local proposals for stricter background check policies.With no criminal record, Uber could not screen out Dalton by traditional methods. When asked whether more in-person vetting, employment references or personality tests like the Myers-Briggs exam could have helped, Davis stressed that ""it's very, very difficult to identify this type of behavior.""""I don't think we will be changing our screening processes... as a result of this incident,"" Sullivan added on the conference call.His comments echoes Uber's chastened statement earlier this month after moving to settle a class action lawsuit over its $1 ""Safe Ride Fee,"" which critics argued constituted false advertising because Uber's safety measures were not in fact ""industry leading.""""No means of transportation can ever be 100% safe,"" Uber said in a statement at the time. ""Accidents and incidents do happen.""That sentiment, however obvious, is striking for the leader of a young market essentially built on taking on the traditional taxi industry by legitimizing the hitchhiking phenomenon that was popular in the 70s and fizzled out in part due to fears over a scattered few crimes and horror stories. ""I don't think I would allow my children to hitchhike, but I do feel comfortable allowing them to take an Uber,"" says Paul Argenti, a corporate communications professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. ""There are protections in place. At some point you put your trust in the system.""Uber, Argenti says, can't stop an otherwise ordinary-seeming employee from snapping suddenly and harming others any more than a traditional taxi company can. Or any business for that matter. Given the scrutiny and social nature of the service, however, it is that much more important for Uber to reassure customers of its safety measures in the wake of the shooting and make sure it doesn't chip away at that trust.The shooter was taking fares in between shootings.

Uber, like many of its peers, has onboarded hundreds of thousands of drivers around the world to drive their own vehicles and act as independent contractors who pick up passengers. The key difference from hitchhiking is that Uber conducts background checks and lets drivers and passengers rate one another to provide more comfort and accountability on both sides.""This is where technology can help ensure safety before, during and after the ride,"" Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, said on the conference call Monday, touting Uber's ratings and GPS tracking functionality.Those ratings, as Mashable has reported, can be imperfect too. Passengers may not think carefully about the ratings. And even if those passengers who rode with Dalton during his erratic period on Saturday gave him poor ratings, it might not have been enough to offset previous high-quality ratings or push Uber to deactivate him.On the conference call, Uber's team noted that it will deactivate drivers within minutes if passengers report driver violence, but if the feedback is about driving quality, the company takes more time to investigate both sides.In search of an emergency buttonIf the background checks can't perfectly screen for unstable drivers and the ratings don't necessarily prevent incidents, what other resource is there?After one of its drivers reportedly raped a passenger in India, Uber added an SOS button for users to more quickly call local authorities through the application. That feature is not currently available in the U.S.Mellen, the passenger who rode with Dalton just before the shootings, decided to reach out to both 911 and Uber to notify them about the driver's erratic behavior. Neither acted on the news prior to the attacks. Davis, the member of Uber's safety board, said Uber received a report about ""erratic driving,"" one of many ride quality feedback reports it receives. There was, he says, ""no indication of a shooting activity"" at that time.""Uber does look into these situations, but they have to contact the driver and look into the story,"" Davis says.

"56c49a2c12d2cd28b9000751","Adario Strange","Tech","Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner in this year's presidential race, aimed his colorful line of political commentary on Wednesday at a new target: Apple and its struggle to maintain the security of the iPhone.
 
The topic came up during a phone-in appearance on Fox and Friends when Trump was asked for his thoughts on Apple's apparent refusal to aid FBI officials attempting to bypass the security on the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.  

See also: Tim Cook: Building a backdoor into the iPhone is 'too dangerous'

""I agree 100% with the courts. In that case we should open [the iPhone] up,"" said Trump, referring to the court's order requesting Apple assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone of one of the shooters. ""We have to use our heads, we have to use common sense.""

In response to the FBI's request for assistance in bypassing the iPhone's security, Apple CEO Tim Cook made a bold play on Tuesday by publishing an open letter explaining why Apple should deny the government's request. 

""The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation,"" Cook wrote. ""In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.""

But in recent debates involving the GOP field of candidates, the general tenor of the discussion has favored policies that would prioritize security backdoors on mobile devices in the interest of combating terrorism over personal privacy rights. 

And while Trump has shaken up the GOP race with a number of unorthodox takes on major political issues, the candidate mirrors the talking points in this area of his Republican competitors.  

""To think that Apple won't allow us to get into [the shooter's] cellphone?"" Trump said. ""Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up."" 

Although the comments are fairly predictable, Trump's specific naming of Apple in the debate on security could put even more pressure on the company to comply with the FBI's request and ultimately thrust Cook himself into the middle of the 2016 race as part of the debate around anti-terrorism efforts. 

""This is a case [where] we should be able to get into the phone,"" Trump said. ""We should find out what happened and why it happened and maybe there are other people involved.""

Not only is Flash a frequent vulnerability target, its non-existent presence on mobile has made it legacy technology with no real future.

Even Adobe renamed its Flash creation suite Adobe Animate CC last Fall.

Still, Flash has persisted on the web, in large part because plenty of advertisers still use it to serve displays ads. Google is in a unique position as both the market leader in both desktop web browsers and as an ad platform to help kill Flash altogether.

For its part, Google has offered HTML5 ad tools for years. And last year, it made HTML5 the default video player for YouTube. 

Forcing advertisers to move to HTML5 for ads is what we hope will be one of the final steps in helping rid all of our web browsers of Flash.

Called Freedom 251, it has been manufactured by a homegrown company, Ringing Bells.

With 220 million users, India is the world's second-largest smartphone market. Since less than one-third of the population uses smartphones, it continues to attract new smartphone brands. 

The company plans to import the components but assemble the phones in India, in accordance with the Indian government's Make in India campaign, which encourages local manufacturing. In the last year, global smartphone makers such as Motorola, Gionee, Lenovo and Xiaomi have started assembling their handsets in India. 

Currently, the most affordable smartphones in India are priced between Rs 1,500 ($22) and Rs 2,000 ($29). Last year, another Indian company DataWind announced its plans to launch the world's cheapest smartphone at Rs 999 ($14.6). 

While Ringing Bells has not revealed too many details about Freedom 251, it is likely to be 3G-enabled. The company had recently launched the country's cheapest 4G smartphone priced at Rs 2,999 ($44).

"56bcde6197b2f866df000ab8","Laura Vitto","Watercooler","When NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reached out to Don and Ryan Clark -- the design duo behind Invisible Creature -- in hopes that they might create custom art for the organization, the pair jumped at the opportunity.

Over the course of three months, they designed a trio of vintage-inspired travel posters for NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Visions of the Future project, a series of pieces now available for free download online.

Each poster is representative of a specific historic space mission-- Invisible Creature was tasked with creating art for the Voyager's Grand Tour, the discovery of Enceladus and NASA's Mars exploration program. Though NASA provided notes, Don Clark tells Mashable that the pair were relatively free to design whatever they envisioned.

""My goal with these was that people would want to hang them up and that they were beautiful and that they lived up to the standard that is NASA,"" Clark said. ""We were inspired by vintage travel posters, WPA-type posters from the 1930s and then all the way up to mid-century modern-- 1940s, 1950s, 1960s.""

""We want that vintage look but we want it to feel contemporary as well,"" he added.

Clark says the chance to design for NASA hit home for he and Ryan, as their grandfather Al Paulsen worked as an illustrator and designer at the organization's Ames Research Center for more than 30 years.

""The project was a no brainer and was really a special one for us,"" he said.

"56c3f072b05f9d253d0001ca","Sandra Gonzalez","Entertainment","""Fame is complicated"" -- so ponders a confused Brian ""Kato"" Kaelin, as played by Billy Magnussen, in the third episode of FX's The People V. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, titled ""The Dream Team."" 

The scene is set. It's 1994, shaggy-haired Kaelin is jogging with a pal in Santa Monica's coastal Palisades Park at the peak of his just-about-exactly 15 minutes of notoriety in association with the Simpson murder trial, having gone from a struggling actor and confused police witness to the World's Most Famous Couch-Surfing Houseguest. 

As the scene plays out, Kaelin is reveling in near-disbelief over his seeming good fortune -- both personally and professionally, without noting that the uptick sprang from the death of once roommate Nicole Brown -- when he's hooted and whooped at admiringly by a bevy of hotties driving by who recognize him from TV. But he barely has a moment to enjoy the attention when another passerby threateningly condemns him for his association with Simpson, who in the pre-trail, post-Bronco chase days appeared perhaps at the most guilty in the public's eyes.

See also: 10 things we wouldn't have if not for the O.J. Simpson trial

It's a moment that reveals to Kaelin -- whose then credits included roles like ""Bond Trader #1"" and ""Party Guest"" -- the double-edged sword sort of notoriety that springs from scandal and controversy, one that can cut the swordsman as deeply as his combatants. Remember, this was a time when MTV's The Real World had only just produced the first generation of semi-everyday people into famous-for-being-famous pseudocelebs, and Kaelin emerged ready-made for the latest breed of reality star. 

The full scope of Kaelin's new life as a pop culture lightning rod only grows after this moment on screen, as we know, but the nod to its beginning marks the emergence of a central theme the show has snuck into the already content-packed folds of its narrative: the price of fame -- or more accurately, infamy.

Whether or not he actually felt even a twinge of conflict in real life, the actual Kaelin certainly cashed in on his then newfound cachet: comedic cameos as himself, game shows, reality series, talk shows, radio hosting, pay-per-view, docu-series, direct-to-video films -- a consistent spate of credits that continues to this day (some on FX). 

And because the show, for all of its vivid and often intense sense of time, place and true crime drama, comes from producer Ryan Murphy (Glee, Scream Queens) and Hollywood's monarchs of the slightly askew biopic kingdom, screenwriters Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander (The People Vs. Larry Flynt, Ed Wood), there's perversely prescient acknowledgement of the First Family of Famous-For-Being-Famous whose reign has its roots in the O.J. Era: the Kardashians.

""It's like life is stranger than fiction,"" Karaszawski says, defending the family's inclusion in the series. ""The embellishments are already there. We're not adding the Kardashian family to something they weren't a part of. It would be ridiculous if we told the story [and] didn't include them, at this date…The thing is, Robert is a major part of the case. The family is not. But the family [became] this thing that sucks up all media, and they all want to talk about Kardashians.""

An earlier scene in the series shows the young brood of Simpson's faithful entrepreneur pal Robert Kardashian -- Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Robert -- hearing their father's name mentioned (and mangled) on TV and uniting in exultation of their momentarily famous surname, clapping and chanting ""Kardashian! Kardashian!"" 

There's another scene in ""The Dream Team"" where the effect is taken a step further as Kardashian, played by David Schwimmer, takes the clan to dinner at Chin Chin, then a moderately upscale Chinese restaurant chain in L.A., and finds the place packed. But not to worry: the hostess recognized him as TV's ""Richard Kardovian"" and cheerfully seats the family immediately in a moment designed to illustrate to the Kardashian kids how fame, however it's earned, and VIP treatment go hand in hand. 

It's a lesson, we grin knowingly as we watch, that the siblings –- as we know them today -- seem to have taken to heart. This despite the admonition from Robert, who by all accounts was as uncomfortable in the spotlight as his offspring revel in basking in it: ""Being a good person and a loyal friend is more important than being famous,"" he reminds them in the scene. ""Fame is fleeting. It's hollow. It means nothing at all without a virtuous heart.""

Although Kardashian's eventually uber-famous children garner barely a passing mention in the book the series is adapted from, Jeffrey Toobin's The Run of His Life: The People V. O.J.Simpson, executive producers Karaszewski and Alexander couldn't resist a few cheeky inclusions, particularly to drive home the story's commentary on infamy. 

""We were taking a little creative license,"" says Alexander, ""saying that Robert's appearance at [Robert] Shapiro's press conference invented the Kardashians. If you want to accept that, it's fine. It's fair enough.""

In the episode, we see how the fame associated with the case cuts both ways, regardless of how virtuous anyone's heart may or may not be. 

After a dynamic performance at her press conference, District Attorney Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson) is praised by her boss with the compliment ""A star is born,"" and she takes a prosecutorial high road by refusing to call witnesses who've lost their credibility by selling their stories to the media (""No cash for trash!""); later, time at home with her son is interrupted by seeing one of her more damning witnesses turn up unexpectedly on a tabloid-style TV show.

Robert Shaprio (John Travolta) revels in his role as Simpson's lead attorney, and the attention and perks it entails, but knowing that he may not be entirely up to the task he assembles the titular dream team of high artillery legal firepower -- even as it galls him to do so, and prompts him to lead by defending his role as the captain of the ship. 

And what defines ""great lawyer"" to Shapiro appears largely associated with, like Shapiro's connections to Johnny Carson and Marlon Brando, depend heavily on their vicinity to fame: F. Lee Bailey (Nathan Lane) is a media darling due to his work on cases involving Patty Hearst, Sam Sheppard and the Boston Strangler. Alan Dershowitz (Evan Handler), after defending the likes of Claus von Bulow and Mike Tyson, was famous enough to offer armchair quarterbacking commentary of the Simpson case live to Larry King before being recruited to Simpson's team; and Johnnie Cochran (Courtney B. Vance), best known at the time as Michael Jackson's attorney.

Cochran himself wrestles with the fame dilemma -- although he knows in his bones that the case is likely fraught with trouble for anyone attempting to establish Simpson's innocence, he wants the case for both its racial overtones and its headline value so badly he allows himself to be duped by a prank caller pretending to be Simpson calling to hire him. It's a humiliating reminder of how the promise of fame (and its equally capricious twin, fortune) can cloud even the clearest eyes.

Finally, in the episode we see that the one who's very likely the most lost in the illusion -- or perhaps delusion -- of personal specialness that fame engenders is the defendant himself, O.J. Simpson (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who's lived most of his adult life as a figure of adulation whose celebrity and personal charisma have obtained things most people can only dream of -- and frequently excused behavior that others would've been called out on. 

Yet locked up, in danger of never returning to that privileged existence he'd cherished for so long, when the notion of adding Cochran to his legal dream team is floated, due to the lawyer's acknowledged expertise in cases involving African-Americans and police misconduct, Simpson resists with a telling refusal that indicates he believes the fame card trumped the race card: ""I'm not black; I'm O.J.!""

And as potent as the fame factor has already proven to be, Simpson would soon learn that issues of race -- which this episode only begins to peel back with the discovery of police detective Mark Fuhrman's reputation -- would be even more powerful in his defense.

"56ccee0cb589e47daf000111","Stan Schroeder","Tech","BARCELONA — Second day in at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and the journalists are nervously staring at their laptop screens, looking for a theme or a topic to wrap up the week’s events and head home. Despite the event’s traditionally huge focus on mobile, it was hard to get excited about a new smartphone this year. Don’t get me wrong. We’ve seen some beautiful smartphones (despite being similar to their predecessors, Samsung’s new Galaxy phones fall into the category) and some daring ones (we’re looking at you, modular LG G5), but this year’s show was more about the wearable gadgets that came with the phones than the phones themselves. And no, we’re not talking about smartwatches — no one even mentioned those this year. No, the 2016 will be all about virtual reality, and not just the Oculus Rift and the Vive variety, plugged into a $1,500+ desktop PC. VR is going mobile this year. SEE ALSO: First look: Samsung Gear 360 consumer VR cameraSamsung took the lead here, filling its enormous Centre de Convencions Internacional event arena with thousands of Gear VR headsets, and showing a part of its presentation in VR. It was an unnerving feeling — one moment you’re surrounded by a throng of people, and then you put the headset on and it’s just you and a huge, floating 3D image of Samsung’s new phones.  It was an unnerving feeling — one moment you’re surrounded by a throng of people, and then you put the headset on and it’s just you and a huge, floating 3D image of Samsung’s new phones.The VR experience wasn’t just a publicity gimmick. If you pre-order a Samsung S7 or S7 Edge phone, you’ll get a Samsung Gear VR headset (a $100 value) thrown in free, meaning there will be a lot of people trying these out this year. LG also has a virtual reality headset now, the LG 360 VR. It’s a lot lighter than Samsung’s, though we have some qualms about its build quality, and we don’t know the exact availability date or the price. But the details don’t matter at this point. The fact is, two of the biggest names in mobile will be pushing VR hard this year. Another big smartphone name, HTC, has focused heavily on its Vive VR headset this year. Even though it’s not a mobile product, it’s getting better by leaps and bounds — the demos I’ve seen here in Barcelona (especially the new Space Pirates shootout game) were polished, fluid and, quite frankly, amazing. At this point it doesn’t look like HTC plans to connect the Vive to its smartphones, but it’s not that hard to imagine them doing so in the future. And we bet that some of the Chinese manufacturers will follow up with VR products of their own. There was exciting news on the other end of the VR spectrum as well: Content creation. Both Samsung and LG launched 360-degree cameras, making it easy for everyone to create immersive content. Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg is heavily invested in this; according to him, the next thing that comes after video is the ability to share whole scenes. That will become a lot easier with the new mobile tools at our disposal. So will we see an army of VR zombies in trains and waiting rooms this year, like in this (already legendary) Mark Zuckerberg photo? It’s hard to say — there will definitely be a lot more eyes immersed in virtual reality this year, and, as people get used to it, they’ll be more willing to use VR headsets with their phones. I’d be surprised to see mobile VR become hugely popular overnight. But the content, the devices and the experience will be getting a lot better, fast. So when you see a guy or a girl wearing a VR headset out in the public, don’t mock or take pity on them as hopeless geeks. Think about what you might be missing. Have something to add to this story?

"56be37c3b589e4455400063e","Christina Warren","Entertainment","According to a new report, Apple is producing a new scripted television series with Dr. Dre.

The Hollywood Reporter broke the story about the series, titled Vital Signs. The show is said to be semi-autobiographical; Dr. Dre will reportedly executive produce and star in the project. Apple acquired Beats -- a company Dre co-founded -- in 2014.

See also: Study: People who listen to music out loud have more sex

Each episode of the series -- it's said to have a six episode order -- will focus on a different emotion and how Dre's character deals with it. Sam Rockwell and Mo McCrae will reportedly star as well.

Perhaps as interesting as the series itself is how it will be distributed: The Hollywood Reporter says that will more than likely come via Apple Music.

Although Apple Music is primarily an audio product, it does feature music videos. In December, Taylor Swift released her concert film, The 1989 World Tour, exclusively on Apple Music.

For years, there have been rumblings of Apple's interest in creating original content à la Netflix and Amazon. Initially, it seemed like the end goal would be to create a video offering that could sit along the Apple TV.

But as those efforts have cooled, it would make sense for Apple instead to focus on Apple Music as a distribution center for video content. After all, Apple Music video content is viewable in iTunes, on iPhones, via Android and on Apple TV.

Moreover, making a TV series part of Apple Music would help further differentiate the service from its biggest competitors. Apple Music now has 11 million paying subscribers -- and it's clear that the company is focused on catching up with Spotify as quickly as it can.

Apple declined Mashable's request for comment.

"56c65252b05f9d6e71000b42","Saba Hamedy","Entertainment","LOS ANGELES -- Amazon Studios is picking up yet another Woody Allen project -- but this one's a little more in his comfort zone.

The company announced Thursday that it has acquired Allen’s upcoming untitled romantic comedy starring Kristen Stewart, Jeannie Berlin, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Corey Stoll, and Ken Stott. The film takes place in the 1930s and was shot last summer in New York and Los Angeles.

This is the second project from Allen that will appear on the platform, the first being a six-part TV series that will also debut later in 2016. Last May, Allen proclaimed the series was ""a catastrophic mistake for me.""

""I’m struggling with it at home,"" he told reporters at The Cannes film festival while promoting The Irrational Man. ""I never should have gotten into it. I thought it was going to be easy. You do a movie and it’s a big long thing; to do six half-hours you’d think would be a cinch. But it’s not: it’s very, very hard.”

At that point in the process, Allen admitted he expected the show to be “a cosmic embarrassment.""

Still the show -- which stars  Allen, Miley Cyrus and Elaine May -- will (literally) go on. Amazon said it begins shooting next month. 

Amazon has already made a name for itself in the TV landscape, winning Golden Globes for both Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle. But following its 2015 release of Spike Lee's Chi-Raq, Amazon has ramped up its efforts to pick up more films.

The studio has several film releases lined up including Paterson, which is directed by Jim Jarmusch (known for indie films like Coffee and Cigarettes) and stars Adam Driver, and Elvis & Nixon, which stars Kevin Spacey and Michael Shannon, with Bleecker Street.

At Sundance Film Festival, Amazon also acquired a ton of titles including Love & Friendship and Complete Unknown.

Allen's untitled film will open this summer in theatrical release nationwide and then will become available to Amazon Prime members through Prime Video.

“Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection, and genuine goodwill -- the lawsuits come later,” Allen said in a statement.

“Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker,” Amazon Studios head Roy Price added in a statement. “We’re so proud to be in business with him for both his next film and his first ever TV series.”

Fortunately, he talked to GQ for a profile that answered some questions you may have about him and raised plenty more. Here are just a few of the subjects he sort of brought light to during the interview.

His pet monkey.
His monkey, OG Mally, was a gift and he kept it because well, as Bieber says, ""If you could get a monkey, well, you would get a fucking monkey, too! Monkeys are awesome.”

He claims that the German government was wrong to take his monkey away. “In Germany, that monkey’s endangered or something…but I had the papers,"" Biebs explained. I even had it written out that he was a circus monkey and he could travel and all that shit. I had all the right papers. Things get twisted.”

However, Bieber does not deny the fact that he could have swung by to pick OG Mally up but did not, nor does he seem to have any particular desire to visit his former pet monkey in the German zoo OG Mally now calls home. But he totally had the papers and would get another monkey one day. 

Chicken fingers.
Bieber enjoys chicken fingers. He even orders them off the menu at the hotel where he lives after selling his mansion to rumored fling Kourtney Kardashian, who does not have a record for egging neighbors' houses. 

See all the photos from Justin Bieber's first GQ cover shoot https://t.co/xhVVqqPb7q pic.twitter.com/uLb21ogN8I— GQ Magazine (@GQMagazine) February 11, 2016

The Mayan people.
He absolutely has no problem with the Mayan people, and dropping trou in front of their ruins was not personal. He just likes taking pictures of himself mooning his bros. 

""Yeah, you know, clarifying that, you know, to the Mayan people or whatever, whoever was…felt any disrespect, I’m truly sorry for that,"" Bieber clarified. ""I never meant to disrespect anybody.”

Saying sorry.
Bieber claims that his guilt has been widely exaggerated, and he has not actually spent the past year constantly apologizing for his very existence. His wildly catch single ""Sorry"" is directed at one girl, not all of humanity. Bieber is owning up to everything he has done, but he's not begging for forgiveness. 

Texting
Bieber is not a fan, “I don’t want people to feel like they can just get in contact with me that easy.” 

Hailey Baldwin
He calls his rumored girlfriend, “someone I really love."" But he doesn't want to put a label on it, because he's scared of opening himself to another heartbreak like he and Selena Gomez caused each other. 

Adderall
Bieber took the drug after chronic insomnia prevented him from staying focused during the day, it gave him anxiety and he decided he needed to stop taking it. Instead, he began seeing the Dr. Carlon Colker, whose claims to fame are diagnosing Jeremy Piven with mercury poisoning and a slew of lawsuits involving diet pills.

"56cceec0b589e47daf000115","Kellen Beck","Tech","You can now turn your smartphone into a laser tag gun, and all you need is an app and a small attachment. Play against other people in local laser tag skirmishes, join a faction and work to control areas around the globe -- all with your smartphone screen.

The game is called Father.IO, and it just went live on Indiegogo. The free app for iOS and Android utilizes your phone’s camera to turn your screen into a classic first-person shooter screen with a gun, a heads-up display of your ammunition and health, along with a map. Paying for the attachment, called the Inceptor, allows you to shoot other players by using built-in infrared emitters and receivers.

See also: The 20 best iPhone games of all time
The game modes
The augmented reality game Father.IO has two main game modes: quick match mode and massive multiplayer. Quick match mode allows you to play free-for-all or team games with local players by sending out an invite to people nearby. Massive multiplayer taps you into a worldwide game of king of the hill, where two factions fight to maintain control of different 150-foot square areas around the globe.

Although you’re playing in present day, the story of Father.IO takes place in the future when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. A virus called Father.IO attacks Earth’s intelligent cloud network and starts taking over, creating a cybernetic race called ""the Evolved."" Father.IO places you with either the Evolved faction bent on destroying humans, or the human faction.

The two factions can fight each other at any point if players have their Inceptors and game on, and can claim different buildings like banks and hospitals to improve their faction’s resources. The game uses data from open source maps of the world to create its own maps.

How it works
Because smartphones aren’t able to register gun hits without the Inceptor, not having the attachment will limit you to just collecting resources for your faction. You will also be unable to participate in the first-person shooter aspect of Father.IO, including the entire quick match mode.

The Inceptor allows you to shoot people up to about 160 feet away, and detects the infrared shots in a 6-foot radius around itself.

Father.IO allows players to play as different classes of fighters, including basic offensive classes, a medic class and a hacker class. The classes all have their strengths and weaknesses, like better armor or more abilities. For example, hackers can steal resources from the enemy faction and remotely attack players, but have low armor and only a pistol.

Some guns are more powerful than others. The pistol takes around 10 hits to kill another player, while the sniper rifle can take someone down in two hits but has a much longer reload time.

There is no paid downloadable content for Father.IO, so you’ll be able to use and unlock every class after you get the Inceptor.
When you can get it
The Inceptors are expected to ship to backers this summer, which normally cost $25 but have early bird specials for $18 and $20. The Father.IO is currently in beta, so if you’re interested in checking it out early you can sign up for iOS or Android.

While there are a few Indiegogo-exclusive gun skins for backers who want to pay for more than just the Inceptor, there are no perks that give players a real advantage over each other.

"56c3b38cb05f9d253d00017f","Cameron Joseph","World","Hillary Clinton called to end zero-tolerance school policies Tuesday afternoon, saying they contribute to inequality and hurt African-American students.

""Let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline,"" she declared in Harlem in a lengthy speech focused on how to ""break down the barriers that disproportionately affect African-Americans.""

See also: Hillary has a secret weapon to stop Bernie's momentum

""We’ve seen a significant increase in police involvement in school discipline,"" she lamented. ""We’re seeing an over-reliance on suspensions and expulsions.""

In the 1990s--with Clinton's backing--schools started to ramp up punishments for students, kicking them out for infractions such as drinking, fighting and drug use and increasing the use of suspensions for cheating on tests. 

Clinton has since changed her views significantly and is now calling to scale back those punishments and to focus more on helping troubled students. She promised to use a carrot-and-stick approach as president, giving money to school districts that shifted their policies and using the Department of Education's civil rights division to try to penalize those who refuse to change.

Clinton's comments come as a number of states with huge African-American populations are set to vote in the Democratic primary. She repeatedly mentioned South Carolina in her speech, and she took a not-so-veiled shot at competitor Bernie Sanders, saying he's a johnny-come-lately on helping African-Americans while she's been in their corner for decades.

""If we continue to ask black people to vote for us we cannot minimize the realities of the lives they lead or take their concerns for granted,"" she said. ""We can’t just show up at election time and say the right things… we can’t just start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.""

According to Chinese media outlets, Hu Guangzhou, 55, has been working on the house for his brothers to move into. But sadly, both of Hu's brothers have been dead for the past 10 years.

Despite local officials' repeated attempts to explain to him that his brothers have passed away, Hu has refused to believe them, reported Epoch Times. People around him have also tried persuading him, but he did not listen.

The house's shape has been compared to the famous dilapidated house in the popular anime Howl's Moving Castle, by celebrated Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki. In the film, the mystical house had more than 80 elements including a wagging tongue, cogwheels and bird feet.

Many Weibo users have praised Hu for his ingenuity and building skills after seeing pictures and reports of his seven-storey innovation.

Although there are concerns about the safety of Hu's house, no one has had the heart to tear it down.

Hu is said to be childless and suffering from ""a biased personality."" It reportedly took the farmer almost five years to build the base of the house, and another three to add the subsequent storeys. In his spare time, repairs and upgrades are made to the house to strengthen its structures.

Hu has repeatedly refused to move into a nursing home, and is currently receiving quarterly subsidies from the local government. A bun store also donates steamed buns to him, reports say.

But Obama wasn't going to let this girl's tears be the final word. Instead, he took to the comments of the Facebook post on Saturday, offering some words of condolence for the young lady, telling her, ""I'm not going anywhere.""

Here's hoping we get to hear what she wrote in that letter.

"56c75a6797b2f86ca0000002","Lance Ulanoff","Tech","Every single hoverboard -- AKA self-balancing scooter -- sold in the U.S. is unsafe. It doesn't matter if you paid $200 or over $1,000, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said on Friday any device without UL certification (not just the charger) ""poses an unreasonable risk of fire to consumers.""

The current number of hoverboards with that certification is zero.

See also: U.S. government declares hoverboards unsafe

The agency publicly sent out a letter that put hoverboard manufacturers, retailers and importers on notice. Those that don't comply could face legal action. The action should stop e-tailers as well as brick-and-mortar stores from selling uncertified hoverboards, but what about the millions already in consumers' hands?

Blame Bieber

How did so many self-balancing scooters get sold before the CPSC and UL could come up with reasonable and safe standards for them? ""It was the perfect storm,"" Elliot F. Kaye, the chairman of the CPSC told me. The products were being imported from China. Hoverboards were the hottest toy of the holiday buying season and there was no manufacturer with a U.S. presence for the CSPC or UL to work with.

Pop stars were riding them and music videos featured them. Demand when through the roof.  Kaye described college students buying hoverboards off Alibaba in bulk and setting up kiosks in malls. No one could get ahead of the fast-moving (literally and figuratively) hoverboards and, before we knew it, they were everywhere.

The hoverboard's place in popular culture has already been fully cemented. Just 36 hours before the government's action, the popular ABC sitcom Modern Family featured Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) riding one for a majority of the show. No mention was made of the safety hazards, but it's a fair bet that Dunphy's hoverboard is just as unsafe as the rest of them. In Taco Bell's featured ad during Super Bowl 50, NBA star James Harden declared the chain's new Quesalupa would be ""bigger than those things"" as he gestures at a guy on a hoverboard.

What now?

Legitimate retailers like Amazon and Modell's may issue recalls, which consumers may or may not comply with, but it seems unlikely the myriad manufacturers selling these products in the U.S. will follow suit. The majority of hoverboards are built in China and then distributed through a number of small, limited liability companies (LLCs) in the U.S. Swagway is one such company.

When we spoke to Swagway CEO Johnny Zhu at CES 2016 in January, he explained that he set up the U.S. arm of Swagway as an LLC to protect against the higher liability of these now officially dangerous products. Put simply, an LLC is a way of shielding larger interests from harm. When I surveyed a handful of other hoverboard manufacturers at the show, they, too, said they had set up LLCs in small cities in the U.S. for the purpose of distributing these Chinese-built products.

As the U.S. government brings down the hammer on hoverboard manufacturers, it's possible that these small companies may fold up shop in the U.S., stop selling the hoverboards and perhaps re-emerge as new companies with certified products.

As a result, many hoverboard owners may be left holding the bag. For many brands, a recall probably won’t be forthcoming and you'll have to decide whether or not you want to continue riding your hoverboard. If you stop, you may have to figure out how to safely dispose of it.

Here's a look at your options:

1. Stop riding it
The CPSC's own test revealed that it is possible to cause hoverboards to melt down. What's more, Chairman Kaye told me there are still issues with the physical safety of riders since the products are not adequately engineered to account for the vastly differing sizes and weights of potential riders. It may be time to put your hoverboard aside.

2. Wait for a recall
While the CPSC did not explicitly order a recall, that action is definitely on the table. Kaye said he expects ""responsible retailers"" to take steps to launch overall recalls. If that happens, you should get an email or snail-mail letter informing you that your hoverboard has been recalled. it will also outline steps you need to take to return the device and obtain a refund.

In the best-case scenario, you would have purchased your hoverboard from a legitimate retailer like Amazon and they issue a global recall -- an act that could cost them millions if they can’t hunt down the dozens of small hoverboard suppliers.

3. Return it

If you bought your hoverboard from a local store, retailer or mall kiosk, you might be able to return it -- especially if it's within 30 days of purchase. I would suggest you bring the CPSC letter with you. Download it here:

4. Shelve it

You can let the hoverboard battery drain down and then put it on a shelf in your garage or shed. Do not store it plugged in. You might also choose to put it in a fire-proof case.

5. Dispose of it

This is easier said than done. Hoverboards are dangerous primarily because of the giant lithium-ion battery inside them (which can overheat, melt down or burst into flames). You can't just throw out the hoverboard with that unstable component inside of it. You’ll need to contact your local recycling center about how to safely dispose of your hoverboard.

It's unlikely that hoverboards will disappear from the American landscape. Manufacturers like Swagway have already promised new, safer models. Those devices could show up within a few months. As long as they have UL certification, they'll make it through customs and go on sale in the U.S. 

These new hoverboards will probably be more expensive -- it costs more to comply with UL requirements -- and in shorter supply as each new shipment is checked by the CSPC for that UL certification.

Photos of a very small, very adorable baby gorilla have been released by Bristol Zoo after she was successfully delivered by cesarean section. The operation is thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, the BBC reports.

The decision to operate was taken after the baby's mother, Kera, suffered pregnancy complications thought to be associated with pre-eclampsia. The delivery procedure took three hours.

""We really thought she was going to die,"" Rowena Killick, a vet at Bristol Zoo, told the BBC.

""We couldn't see any signs of life apart from the heartbeat... and then eventually she showed signs that she was going to breathe for herself.""

Although Kera and her baby are not completely out of the woods yet, staff at Bristol Zoo have suggested there are some promising signs.

""Kera is still not 100%,"" Killick said. ""She's still recovering, she's eating and drinking and she's started moving around a bit more normally.""

The reunion was made possible by a dedicated team of volunteers and the power of Facebook. 

Kunkush the cat was flown to Norway and was finally back in the arms of his owner, who wept at his return. The family had fled from their home in Mosul, Iraq, months earlier and resettled in the Nordic country. Mosul is now controlled by Islamic State militants.

The Guardian was recorded the moment the family held their beloved pet for the first time after he was flown from Berlin to Norway; video is embedded below.

Kunkush's return to his family was no simple affair -- it required help from dozens of do-gooders from all over the world and the help of a dedicated Facebook group to publicize the search. His journey began when the mother and five children, fled Iraq last year, bringing along their beloved family cat. 

They eventually made their way to the Mediterranean and crossed to the Greek island of Lesbos aboard a crowded boat in an attempt to build a new life in Europe. Kunkush was right there with them, carried in a small basket. But soon after they landed on the shore, the frightened cat hopped out of the basket and ran away. The family and local volunteers looked for several hours, but had no luck finding him. Eventually, the family had to move on to a registration camp without him, and then like thousands of others, they continued on. 

But the cat returned a week later, and was found by volunteer workers who remembered that the family had lost him. They named him Dias, the modern Greek name for the god Zeus, and took him in. They were sure the family was further along on their journey into Europe. The crew tried doggedly to hunt down the cat's owner, plastering reception centers with posters of the cat, spreading the information through a network of aid workers and providing contact details so the family could reach them. 

They also set up a Facebook page, called ""Reunite Dias"" to find the cat's family and provided rolling updates as his condition improved. Local volunteers Amy Shrodes and Ashley Anderson, who had been working with refugees on the island, took Kunkush into her care in Greece while they waited for word about his owners. 

""I know how much hope means to a person that has nothing else left,"" said Shrodes in a statement sent to Mashable. ""I felt strongly that if this family took such a huge effort to bring him with them, they must consider him a part of their family. It wouldn’t be right to not give them a chance to at least know he’s okay, and even take him back if they’re in a place where they can.” 

Eventually, Shrodes brought him to a foster home in Berlin while they waited for news. The family offered to keep him for a year while the search continued, and planned to adopt him if his family was not found. 

All of the searching finally came to an end on Feb. 14, when volunteers behind the reunion Facebook page shared the exciting news that the family had been found. An Iraqi family in Norway, who wished to remain anonymous, had seen the Facebook page and reached out to connect the cat with his owners. 

The Facebook page posted this video of Kunkush on his way to Norway earlier this week.

Finally, on Thursday, he was back in their arms.

The family had a chance to Skype with the volunteers who made the reunion possible from their home in Steinjker, Norway, on Thursday.  The team behind the ""Reunite Dias"" Facebook page paid for his care, pet passport and flights out of pocket, and are raising funds on a Go Fund Me page to cover the costs. 

""We’ve received confirmation in the form of photos as well as the family’s historical account. His real name is Kunkush and the cat is very responsive to the name,"" the volunteers announced on Facebook. ""More than 4,000 Facebook users have been supporting Kunkush’s campaign. Every share has helped us get one step closer to this happy ending. Thank you all for staying hopeful and being a part of this journey.""

"56cb030897b2f80bba000228","Raymond Wong","Tech","BARCELONA -- Sony's new Xperia X smartphones are slick, but even cooler are the concept products the company unveiled.

Building on its rad Life Space UX products, Sony announced at Mobile World Congress a couple of new intelligent concept devices, including an adorable little robot called the Xperia Agent, that are designed to help users live a smarter connected lifestyle.

See also: Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge bring back all the features the GS6 left out

The Xperia concept devices are part of Sony's initiative to help users reconnect with reality. Instead of constantly interacting with your gadgets, Sony wants them to adapt to you and your environment.

""Sony Mobile envisions this new category as intelligent devices that understand preferences, activities and behavior, to provide useful and contextual information,"" the company wrote in an official Sony Mobile blog post.

Though the devices are conceptual, they are provide a glimpse at what could come in the future. (Well, Sony's vision of the future, at least.)

Xperia Agent

Sony envisions the Xperia Agent personal assistant robot as a kind of Amazon Echo/R2-D2 hybrid. The little robot has a round head that turns and digital ""eyes"" that give it some personality. It looks so damn cute. If you're gonna have a robot in your home, it's important it looks friendly.

The Agent can use its built-in projector to display useful information like the news or weather. It can also project photos and videos.

It'll reportedly be able to respond to voice commands and gestures. As a communications tool, Sony says the Agent can be used to make calls, send messages and update social networks using dictation.

The Xperia agent robot too adorb pic.twitter.com/54ZbyWvSzq— Raymond Wong (@raywongy) February 22, 2016

There's not a whole lot of specs for the Xperia Agent. Right now, the projections are non-interactive, but that could change for future models or if the Agent is ever released.

Sony also sees the Agent being a smart hub of sorts, connecting to smart home appliances and controlling them.

Xperia Ear

The realest device of the bunch, the Xperia Ear is a wireless earbud that fits in your ear and works very much like the Moto Hint. 

Scheduled for a release this summer, the Xperia Ear connects to Android phones through NFC or Bluetooth and lets you use voice commands to perform tasks like making calls, texting and getting directions.

Checking out the Xperia Ear pic.twitter.com/RX03tAMOHo— Raymond Wong (@raywongy) February 22, 2016

The Xperia Ear will come in a number of different colors and its case doubles as a charger.

Xperia Eye

The Xperia Eye is Sony's own version of a life-logging camera and is very similar to the Narrative Clip. It has a 360-degree spherical lens on one side and can be worn on a shirt collar or around your neck, or mounted onto things like a bicycle's handlebar. Sony also showed off a waterproof housing, a carabiner clip and a tripod for the camera at its booth.

Xperia Eye camera concept pic.twitter.com/9WBCQNQ4Tv— Raymond Wong (@raywongy) February 22, 2016

The camera's designed to automatically take photos at set intervals to capture life's moments so you can worry less about taking photos and just live life. 

Sony says the camera responds to voice commands and has built-in facial recognition technology, but we didn't get to see those features in action.

Xperia Projector

The Xperia Projector is yet another portable interactive projector from Sony and it's similar to the prototype projector we saw at IFA, but it has built-in voice controls. Users can project different apps and media onto surfaces like a table or the wall and then touch them to manipulate them.

In one demo, Sony showed the Xperia Projector projecting screens onto a table with a calendar you could swipe through and a notes app that you could make doodles on. 

Sony didn't provide details on how bright the projections could be or what sizes they could span. The projections shown were quite small and not particularly bright, to be honest.

In another concept demo, you could use the built-in camera to make a video call.

In an op-ed titled “Madeleine Albright: My Undiplomatic Moment” posted Friday in The New York Times, the former U.S. Secretary of State addresses critiques of a recent speech she gave in Concord, New Hampshire on Feb. 6.

See also: Hillary Clinton's struggle with women has never been more clear than in New Hampshire

At the end of a speech endorsing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Albright addressed the women in the audience, stating, “You have to help. Hillary Clinton will always be there for you. And, just remember, there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.”

The comment was received with a loud round of applause from Hillary supporters. Clinton herself doubled over in laughter after the remark. But not everyone was amused, with critics saying Albright’s message suggested women should vote for Clinton simply because she is also a woman -- or else get a free ticket to that ""special place in hell.""

Madeleine Albright just said that women who don't vote for Hillary are ""going to hell"". Sadly, my lovely wife, apparently, is doomed.— Roggar (@UrfangtheWolf) February 6, 2016

The phrase that sparked the outrage -- ""there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other” --is one Albright has used for 25 years, according to the diplomat. 

“But this time, to my surprise, it went viral,” she penned in the op-ed

It's the danger of being a high-profile feminist in the age of social media. Small soundbites from one speech or one statement can seemingly damage your entire reputation as a champion for women in an instant. Whether comments are taken out of context or a noted name misspeaks, feminists like Albright are under an intense amount of scrutiny to represent feminism without a misstep at all times.

Just one day before Albright's comments, Gloria Steinem received similar criticism for her statement suggesting young women support Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders because ""the boys are with Bernie."" 

Seriously, @GloriaSteinem, ""because the boys are with Bernie""? How about ""because young women have a choice & like Bernie""? Shame on you.— Geek Girl Diva (@geekgirldiva) February 7, 2016

Both Albright and Steinem, who are considered feminist trailblazers, probably didn't do much to convince the public that women have political autonomy with their comments. But the heightened attention around each misstep also points to these women being under critical surveillance each time they speak. Many critics, after all, are looking for any chance not to take these women, or their feminist views, seriously.

In a society that doesn't value the voices of women, those who don't champion feminism will often jump at the chance to try and prove these women don't really support other women -- even if their work historically has proven otherwise.

In the op-ed, Albright says she still believes in the importance of women helping each other to overcome gender inequality, though she didn’t mean to suggest that women should “support a particular candidate based solely on gender.” Yet, she says, she also understands how her words could have been read to be condemning toward women who disagree with her politics.

“If heaven were open only to those who agreed on politics, I imagine it would be largely unoccupied,” she writes.

In the piece, Albright also emphasizes that gender equality and equal opportunity are still not national realities for women, which is why she encourages women to lift each other up with this particular catchphrase. In a moment of vulnerability, Albright says even she feels “a squirm of anxiety when I interrupt a discussion in a room with only men.” 

Yet, sticking to her endorsement of Clinton, Albright writes that having a woman in office would help achieve more strides toward greater equality for women. Calling on the importance of history, Albright says voting for Clinton builds upon the framework women leaders have built -- a framework that has made it possible for Clinton to even be considered a candidate for presidential office.

“In a society where women often feel pressured to tear one another down, our saving grace lies in our willingness to lift one another up,” she writes. “And while young women may not want to hear anything more from this aging feminist, I feel it is important to speak to women coming of age at a time when a viable female presidential candidate, once inconceivable, is a reality.”

"56c5a37cb589e46e30000649","Victoria Ho","World","SINGAPORE -- Loan sharks have found another way of chasing down bad loans from borrowers who abscond before paying their debts.On Thursday, a man who worked for a phone company was found guilty of abusing his privileged access to confidential information. As a customer service officer, Tay Kun Hong could retrieve user details such as addresses and national identification numbers, which he handed over to loan sharks in exchange for bribes, ChannelNewsAsia reported.SEE ALSO: Singapore customs seizes half-ton shipment of smuggled elephant tusksTay worked for M1, the phone company, in March 2015. Under pressure from a loan shark himself, he agreed to accept S$5 ($3.56) per customer to disclose hundreds of user details. The loan shark he was working for got him to rope in a friend who worked for SingTel, who also provided hundreds of entries to the illegal moneylender. Tay was paid a commission for the hookup.Often, loan sharks make copies of debtors' state-issued identity cards when they lend money. When people flee their debts, they might move and change their phone numbers to evade debt collectors, but a phone company would have updated records of phone numbers and billing addresses connected to the identity card number.In addition to the privacy breaches that Tay was found guilty of, charges against him included helping loan sharks with other tasks, such as accepting S$200 ($142) to harass a debtor by splashing paint and writing on their walls.Loan sharks in Singapore have also adopted other methods of harassment, such as notifying a borrower's neighbour of bad debt, in order to embarrass them.hahahah wtf. now loanshark new level by wasting stamp and mail to all the neighbor  pic.twitter.com/KqyPjxs0b6— gaily (@gailmez) February 16, 2016
Tay's actions violated the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, as well as the Moneylenders Act, for assisting the loan sharks, and the Prevention of Corruption Act for accepting bribes.He was sentenced to a S$90,000 ($64,125) fine and 17 months in jail, where he will be receiving three whips of the cane.Caning punishments in prisons in Singapore employ a rattan cane, and are carried out by a trained prison officer.Have something to add to this story?

"56c05e3112d2cd6bae00071b","Samantha Cooney","Business","The candlelight and chocolate-fueled romance of Valentine’s Day will probably inspire many couples to put a ring on it this year.But it also means that those couples will need to have some less-than-rosy conversations about how to merge and manage finances together.And while money might not be able to buy you love, it can destroy it: studies show that arguing about money early on in a relationship can ultimately spell its end. So some personal finance experts gave us their tips on how to successfully join forces when it comes to finances.“I think a lot of problems around money and couples occur when you don’t talk about it — and don’t have accountability,” Sophia Bera, a certified financial planner at Gen Y Planning, says. “You don’t have one sex talk. It’s the same way with money. It’s many conversations over time.”Communication is the key to $uccessIt’s a given that good relationships are built on a foundation of communication and trust, and this couldn’t be more true when it comes to dealing with your finances. “You need to have a very frank and honest conversation with your partner about everything,” Erin Lowry, a personal finance expert and founder of the Broke Millennial, says. That means you need to sit down and figure out the financial health of yourself and your financial partner shortly after the engagement.""In the first weeks after the engagement, you might talk about how plans might look together,"" Bill Liatis, the CEO and Co-Founder of CreditIQ, says. ""It’s good to know what their spending power is, what debt they might be in, what their goals are, and where their money is.""And Lowry also advises that newly-engaged couples look at each other credit reports, which will give you insight into your partner’s financial situation — and might hint at relationship red flags, like defaulting on debt or if there are big charges that you didn’t know about.“It’s a good way — and a non-sneaky way — to check in and make sure everything is as it appears,” Lowry says.After this initial meeting, Bera says it’s important to make sure that communication on cash remains a constant in your relationship. She suggests you and your partner have a weekly money date, where you discuss matters big and small — from how much you’ll spend on your best friend’s birthday gift to how much of your salary will go toward your 401K contribution.“If you can just check off one small financial task at that weekly half hour meeting, you’ll be so surprised about how much you can do in a year,” Bera says.Add financial planning to your wedding to-do listThere’s certainly a great deal of planning that goes into a wedding: finding the right venue, picking out the perfect dress or suit, choosing the flowers, and perfecting the frosting and flavor on that cake. But you should add one more thing to your pre-wedding to-do list: getting yourself into good financial shape. “I see a lot of couples that are getting married and have completely different financial situations,” Bera says. “I think it’s important that as individuals, before you get married, you put yourself in as good as a financial situation you can be in to merge finances as a couple.”That means that you should try to pay off as much of as many outstanding loans that you can budget, cancelling extra accounts that are costing you money, dropping bad money habits, and educating yourself on how to spend wisely. You should write your future spouse into your will, and add them to your life insurance policy and 401K.Figure out how you both want to split costsMany couples might be tempted to split costs equally. But while that may be empowering, it might not be the smartest financial move.“Some people say, ‘oh we’ll just divide everything, and then we’ll figure it out from there,’ Bera says. “But I think that isn’t usually the best thing when you have different partners making different amounts.”Instead, your percentage of the contribution should be determined by your salary. For instance, if one partner makes $100,000 and the other makes $50,000, the first partner should be contributing more — perhaps ⅓ more — to the household. But both of you should sit down and do the math on all of your monthly expenses — including rent, groceries, bills — and then set a fixed amount that’s both financially and emotionally feasible to both partners.“It should be a team mentality when you’re handling finances,” Lowry says. The other thing that you and your partner will have to decide is how you want to conquer debts: in today’s age, it’s likely that at least one partner might enter a marriage with some sort of outstanding debt. While it’s a personal decision as to who in the relationship should take on paying off those debts, both Lowry and Bera says you can’t go wrong with a ‘together is better’ approach.Lowry says that she and her longtime boyfriend have had lots of discussions as to how to handle his student loan debt should they get married. While he insisted on paying it off, Lowry says that if they get married, they’ve compromised so that his paycheck is going to paying off the loan and hers is going to a higher portion of the household expenses.“I feel that it’s still something that will impact my life, so it’s something we should do together,” Lowry says. “You need to reach that middle ground where both partners are happy.”Work together — and apartAnother big question that plagues couples is the issue of bank accounts: is it better to have a joint account or keep ‘em separated?Ultimately, couples should figure out what works best for them — but most personal finance consultants suggest you can’t go wrong with a joint account that covers all joint costs, and individual accounts that serve as security blankets.Bera suggests that it might even be inspiring for couples to keep a joint savings account to save for either a big purchase, like a new apartment or house, or a fun and romantic getaway.“You never entirely merge your accounts,” Liatis says.  “You can do some things to maintain some levels of independence.”Lowry says that it’s important to maintain the mindset that any money in joint accounts can be taken away from you — whether it’s a bad breakup and your partner cleans you out, or your partner turns out to be an irresponsible spender. But she cautions it’s also important to be honest with your partner about your security fund.“If you are in a committed relationship with joint finances and you have a secret stash of cash, it is a form of financial infidelity,” Lowry says.The best option is for both partners to agree to keep separate accounts that neither will have the ability to access but that both know exist.“Should everything go sideways, you’ll know that your partner does have some kind of stash to support themselves — and you’ll have the same,” Lowry says.Give them some breathing roomMany problems that deal with money and matters of the heart are caused by different spending habits. But there’s an easy way to put the kibosh on that, personal finance experts say.Lowry advises that you keep your own credit card away from your partner — primarily so you can keep control over your own credit. But make sure you and your partner discuss just how much you’re putting on each of your own credit cards each month, and that you create a plan on how you’ll be paying off your cards.You and your partner should set a spending limit each month that won’t be monitored. For instance, maybe and your partner agree that you can each spend $20 a week — without judgment from your partner. That way you can enjoy your $6 latte without judgment from your French Press-addicted partner — and you will be able to minimize stress when you see your partner isn’t spending money the way you’d spend it.“You can’t be a financial bully, and say he or she can’t spend anything,” Lowry says. “That’s no fair.”But big purchases, like a new car, should always involve a conversation between you and your partner — even if you’re spending your own money on it. “Getting on the same page as your cashflow is going to help you in every other aspect of your finances — and that might save people’s marriages,” Bera says.Protect your heart (and your bank account)Your relationship might end. Making effort to protect yourself — and your finances — is always a good idea.“There are so many people who are so ignorant about their finances, and say, ‘Oh, my partner just takes care of it,’” Bera says.In any relationship where finances are shared, it’s key to know exactly where your money — down to the nitty gritty details. Know just how many accounts you and your partner have, make sure you and your partner are being honest about where the money is going, and make sure you know how to access your accounts.You and your partner might also want to consider sign a prenuptial agreement. You might believe prenuptial agreements are archaic creatures reserved for characters in Edith Wharton novels or the Bennifers (R.I.P) of the world. But really, prenuptial agreements aren’t reserved for the wealthy — and they can save you a lot of pain — and provide you with a lot of financial protection should your marriage sadly go south.“Plenty of people think there is no reason to have a prenup if the partner's aren't bringing wealth into the relationship, but you might also want to have a prenup to protect yourself from any debt your partner is bringing into the relationship,” Lowry says.Enlist a family lawyer to draft an enforceable agreement that honestly reflects how both you and your partner would want to divide up your assets should you break up.“It can be a very touchy topic to bring up, so do it tactfully and emphasize how a prenup can protect both parties in a marriage. You are ultimately signing a legal document that financially yokes you to another person,” she says. “It's just good business sense to protect yourself.”Have something to add to this story?

Photos of a very small, very adorable baby gorilla have been released by Bristol Zoo after she was successfully delivered by cesarean section. The operation is thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, the BBC reports.

The decision to operate was taken after the baby's mother, Kera, suffered pregnancy complications thought to be associated with pre-eclampsia. The delivery procedure took three hours.

""We really thought she was going to die,"" Rowena Killick, a vet at Bristol Zoo, told the BBC.

""We couldn't see any signs of life apart from the heartbeat... and then eventually she showed signs that she was going to breathe for herself.""

Although Kera and her baby are not completely out of the woods yet, staff at Bristol Zoo have suggested there are some promising signs.

""Kera is still not 100%,"" Killick said. ""She's still recovering, she's eating and drinking and she's started moving around a bit more normally.""

The pope, who is making his 12th trip abroad, delighted journalists traveling aboard the papal plane when he placed it atop his head and smiled for the cameras.

Journalists on board were quick with their smartphones to take photos of the pontiff who shall henceforth be known as #SombreroPope.

The traditional hat was given to the pope by Mexican TV correspondent Valentina Alazraki, who the Catholic News Service describes as ""the journalist who has done the most papal trips."" It's actually a thing Alazraki does -- she gave similar hats to St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, too.

The hat features the pope, his coat of arms and Our Lady of Guadalupe, an image of the Virgin Mary as seen in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in México City.

Pope Francis has said his deepest desire for his trip to Mexico is to simply pray before the shrine. Speaking to reporters en route to his first stop in Havana, Cuba, Francis said he knew that the Virgin is beloved to Catholics and even those who are not.

""The most scientific study says this is something of God. This is what I'll tell the Mexicans, even those who say 'I'm atheist but I'm a Guadalupeño.' — Then he corrected himself: ""Some Mexicans. Not all are atheists.""

Francis arrives in Mexico Friday night and he's due to celebrate Mass in the Basilica of Guadalupe on Saturday evening. The trip to Mexico lasts through Wednesday.

"56bcad6e97b2f866df000784","Megan Specia","World","Dozens are dead at a prison in a city in northern Mexico after a fire and riot broke out in the early hours of Thursday, according to accounts from several local news outlets. 

Family members stormed the prison gates of Topo Chico prison in Monterrey on Thursday morning, demanding information about their loved ones who were still inside. 

Fifty-two inmates were killed and 12 injured in the violence. Two rival gangs being held at the prison reportedly were at the center of the riot, according to a statement from the state governor.

Nuevo Leon Gov. Jaime Rodriguez told a news conference the fight involved a faction led by a member of the infamous Zetas drug cartel.

The situation quickly spilled over into a protest in the streets as people looked for answers and an explanation about what was going on behind the sealed gates.

It is still unclear what sparked the riot and fires, but Mexico's 24 Horas news outlet says gangs organizing an escape attempt may have intentionally set the fire to distract prison guards.

Several inmates may have escaped during the chaos. Members of the Mexican army, the Civil Police Force and local Monterrey police have all been deployed to the prison.

Rescue workers could be seen bringing injured inmates -- some of whom appeared to have burns --  out from the prison. The number of dead was unclear. Officials of the Nuevo Leon state government declined to make immediate comment, but said they would make an announcement later.

Images broadcast by Milenio Television showed the fire continuing to blaze near dawn, with a crowd of people bundled against the cold gathered outside the prison. Some shook and kicked at the prison gates, demanding to be allowed in.

Aerial videos from outside the prison show people gathered on the roof of the prison facility.

Witnesses said the fire broke out at about 12:30 a.m. local time amid shouts and sounds of explosions. 

A thick cloud of smoke rose, apparently from inmates burning mattresses.

Luella first rose to fame in a viral video where she twirled prettily for a police horse, while wearing a fashion-forward burgundy sweater and gold chain.

She ""works"" at a swanky boutique in Manhattan called Love Gang, which is owned by her human Cara Bloch and Carmen Ruiz-Davila. The pretty pooch has become a beacon of fashion inspiration for everyone in New York's stylish East Village neighborhood.

In honor of New York Fashion Week, I interviewed Luella at Love Gang to see what life is like for New York's most popular fashion-loving Frenchie.

As I entered the store, Luella was chilling in a comfortable but fashionable hoodie and sneakers. She seemed to think these shoes are the closest she can get to a pair of Yeezy's, as Kanye has yet to make sneaks small enough for her little paws.

I offered Luella a bit of my scone but she preferred eating crumbs off the floor, as cleaning makes her feel more useful around the shop and snacking only on crumbs helps her keep her physique.

She also introduced me to her fashionista friend Lola, whose exotic mix of multiple breeds made her a standout on camera. Her signature ears and brindle color are bound to make her a superstar in the fashion world.

Luella seemed to think Lola's underdog story makes her a great face for any advertising campaign. The brindled beauty was adopted from a shelter after being found on a beach in Puerto Rico. 

They also enjoy sitting together front row at all the hottest Fashion Week shows, as it's the perfect place to gossip while wearing oversized faux fur jackets, which are all the rage this season.

While Lola will always be a close confidant, Luella still makes sure the spotlight is on her. 

And how can she help it? She was born to pose for the camera.

When questioned about her own unique look, Luella told us through body language that she's a purebred. However, she's had her own hardships as the runt of her litter. With siblings much larger than she, Luella had to fight for attention from her parents. Fashion ended up being what helped her stand out from the pack and it's what brought her the attention she so craved.

While Luella is tiny in physique, her big personality shines on camera and in person. She's just as comfortable in a sparkly ensemble as she is in the nude with just a pair of headphones and a beanie. 

I decided to delve a bit deeper with Luella and ask her where she sees fashion and beauty going in the future, and whether she will consider any type of procedure as she ages.

She seemed to think plastic surgery is overrated, displaying her squashed nose proudly. Wrinkles are a part of her look and she doesn't see herself ever doing anything to get rid of them.

As for the future of fashion, the sassy Luella seemed to think she's it.

Seeing how effortlessly perfect she appears in every outfit, we can't help but agree.

Minus 18, an Australian nonprofit that serves LGBTQ youth, recently decided to hold a formal dance for their clients. An antigay coalition called 'STOP Safe Schools' soon caught wind of this ""heathen"" prom and decided to do everything they could to shut it down. But in trying to close it, they made one small tiny error -- and accidentally raised thousands of dollars for LGBTQ youth.

Hell yeah.

To stop the dance, STOP Safe organizers decided to buy as many tickets as they could. Their goal was to buy out the entire event, then not show up, making it impossible for real teens to attend. The tickets, they wrote in their original Facebook post, which has since been taken down, were nontransferable. Little did they realize, every ticket purchased on behalf of 'STOP SAFE' could make a real difference in the life of LGBT teens.

But STOP Safe's efforts were, in fact, too successful -- and the organization quickly raised thousands of dollars for Minus 18. Instead of shutting the event down, Minus 18 decided to simply move the event to a larger venue. 

When ticketholders, including the STOP Safe purchasers, failed to show up to the event, Minus 18 pledged to give those tickets to LGBTQ youth on the waitlist. By raising so much money, STOP Safe effectively subsidized tickets for hundreds of LGBTQ youth.

""Thanks to the generous support of the entire community, the Same Sex Gender Diverse Formal 2016: Victoria will be FREE for all young people to attend,"" Minus 18 wrote on their Facebook page yesterday.

While MInus18's initial fundraising goal was just $15,000, they have now raised over $45,000 on their crowdfunding page.

""We’re going to go home to New Jersey tomorrow, and we’re going to take a deep breath,"" Christie told in New Hampshire Tuesday night, adding that he and his family ""will make a decision on our next step forward based on the results that come in here in New Hampshire.""

Christie said Tuesday that he left New Hampshire ""without an ounce of regret.""

Christie was also not set to qualify for the next Republican debate, set for Saturday in South Carolina, leaving him little opportunity to regain momentum lost after New Hampshire.

The brash New Jersey governor never caught fire in a tangled field where all of the establishment-leaning candidates have struggled. But he had some brief sparks: an emotional speech highlighting the personal costs of drug addiction went viral, an endorsement from the powerful New Hampshire Union-Leader breathed late life into his campaign, and Christie's own election-eve attacks on Marco Rubio's robotic repetition of talking points drew national attention while throwing the Florida senator off his game.

The New Jersey governor had long ago been viewed as a potential power-house in the race, someone who could appeal to blue-collar voters and independents and give Republicans a good shot at the White House. 

But the ""Bridgegate"" scandal, in which top aides shut down a bridge and caused a traffic jam to punish a local mayor for not backing Christie's 2013 reelection, badly hurt him from the start. The scandal scared away the power players and big donors he would have needed to make a splash in the race, and left him poorly funded and out of the spotlight throughout much of his campaign. 

Christie was never well-positioned to appeal to the party's hardline conservative base, and following a less-than-stellar showing in a state he had to succeed in he decided to drop out.

This cumbersome situation is commonly faced by caregivers who are shopping with someone who uses a wheelchair. But a shopping cart solution has been invented with mobility-related disability in mind -- and it’s coming to a Target store near you.

In a recent announcement, Target says they are investing in Caroline’s Carts, shopping carts that have chairs big enough to hold older children and adults with mobility-related disabilities. The carts enable parents and caregivers to shop without having to maneuver a cart and a wheelchair throughout the store simultaneously.

By March 19, all Target stores that use standard shopping carts will also house at least one Caroline’s Cart for customer use. 

But, depending on where you live, you may have already seen the cart in your local store. Target has been testing the new design in a select stores around the country for about a year -- and the company says the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

@Target THANK YOU for the Caroline's Cart! Huge help for SN families. Simon's so excited he can now shop with Mommy! pic.twitter.com/Oz6ktPYBj5— Laura LeBrun Hatcher (@HatcherDesign) November 13, 2015

The inclusive carts were created by Drew Ann Long, an inventor and stay-at-home mother from Alabama. Long’s daughter Caroline, who lives with Rett syndrome and uses a wheelchair, was 7 years old when Long realized she was quickly outgrowing standard shopping carts. Long, along with her husband, founded Parent Solution Group in 2008 to design the carts, partnering with shopping cart manufacturer Technibuilt to produce the carts a short time later.

The design features a chair large enough for an adult, a departure from the tiny seats of standard shopping carts. The larger seat also has a seatbelt to keep a loved one securely fastened in the cart. Adjustable, foam-covered handles provide steering control for a parent or caregiver navigating the cart.

And, don't worry, there's still plenty of basket room and under-cart storage.

Target says the idea to implement Caroline's Carts actually came from within the Target family. A team member suggested the carts to management because she and her child, who has a mobility-related disability, often had a hard time shopping at the store where she worked.

“Caroline’s Cart can be a game-changer for families, and we’re excited to offer this for our guests across the country,” Juan Galarraga, senior vice president of store operations at Target, said in a press release. “Target is always looking for new ways to make guests feel welcome in our stores and give them a more comfortable shopping experience. We’re always listening to both our guests and team members, and making changes based on their feedback.”

""The Grammys announced a performance by Ms. Lauryn Hill prematurely and without approval.

Artist AnaHell created a project titled Secret Friends, which depicts strange characters in ordinary situations.

AnaHell has people bend over as she draws faces on their backs. She dresses their bodies to look like they're standing upright, thereby creating the creatures that she calls her 'Secret Friends'.

See also: What do you wish you could text to your first love? 'The Unsent Project' wants to know

""I'm a Spanish artist with a background in illustration and I'm fond of cartoons and passionate about absurdity and surrealism,"" AnaHell told Mashable in an email. 

""My main focus in art and in photography is to work with what is around me and transform it to reveal another perspective,"" she said. ""Lately I shy away from fancy equipment and studios, I try to keep it light and raw to make the viewer feel a lot closer to the subject.""

The idea for the project came organically, during a different shoot.

""It happened really spontaneously during a creative shoot in which I was working on creating body postures that created an illusion that would be mind bending,"" AnaHell said. ""In one of the positions it just clicked, I had a 'Eureka' moment and told my model to stay put and ran and grabbed an eyeliner and drew two circles on the creature's new face. That was the birth of Secret Friends.""

The project places each character into what the artist calls ""very banal"" situations, including taking out the trash or laying in bed.

""The idea is to mimic everyday circumstances with a bit of a satirical view to poke fun at modern day life,"" she said.

When selecting her models, AnaHell prefers to work with her most limber friends.

""A certain level of flexibility is needed, but I really like to work with people that are close to me and that I know well, it makes the shooting a lot more fun,"" she said.

Reactions to AnaHell's photographs have been varied.

""It's been absolutely crazy, there have been so many different reactions but no one seems to be indifferent,"" she said. 

""Some people are completely freaked out (even grossed out) by Secret Friends, other people are delighted by them and find them extraordinary,"" AnaHell said. ""I think they're really cute and funny and it's amazing how someone can take on a whole new identity when they become a Secret Friend.""

One thing is for certain -- no one can deny that these images are fascinating. 

Despite people's polarized views on the Secret Friends, AnaHell has many plans for them.

""I'm going to take them around the world and there may also be some satire on current events,"" she said. ""I'm also in the process on working on some video projects with them and one of my main goals is to make a Secret Friends book.""

NATO's role, he said, will be to contribute ""critical information and surveillance to help counter human trafficking.""

Intel gathered by NATO on criminal networks smuggling migrants and refugees would be passed to Turkish authorities, who would then go after them.

Stoltenberg said the mission would not be about ""stopping or pushing back refugee boats,"" but Turkey would take back refugees picked up by NATO.

NATO's Standing Maritime Group 2, under German command, will lead the operation in cooperation with Greek and Turkish coastguards, NATO's press office said.

Greece, by way of the Aegean, has been the main transit route to the European Union for some 80% of migrants and refugees from Africa, Asia and the Middle East, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. About 75,000 migrants and refugees have already arrived in Greece by sea in 2016. At least 409 people have died en route.

The Turkish Coast Guard released this dramatic footage showing the rescue of a man clinging to the nose of a sinking boat off the coast of Turkey on Monday. In it, the coast guard helicopter lowers a crew member into the water before carrying him to safety.

The man was lucky. Twenty-seven migrants, including 11 children, reportedly drowned in the Aegean on Monday.

9. Byron Bay, New South Wales
    In #ByronBay, you can watch the sun set and rise over the ocean - if you pick the right spot! This lookout is at the Pass - a picturesque beach which faces north-west, resulting in superb sunsets. Or if you're an early riser, nearby is the #CapeByronLighthouse - the most easterly point of mainland Australia, so you can be the first in Australia to see the sun rise. We'll take both, please!

Moreover, they (well, actually the wife) set a world record for fastest production SUV when the Model X put down a quarter-mile time of 11.61 seconds, reaching 0 to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds and doing 0 to 100 mph in 7.9 seconds.

Although the Model S P90D with Ludicrous acceleration mode was quicker, it wasn't by much. The Model S did a 11.24-second quarter-mile, reaching 118.5 mph.

Tesla's chief technical officer admitted to me at the launch of the Model X that one of the things the upstart EV automaker struggled with perfecting was the aerodynamics on their first SUV. It was that work that allowed the seven-passenger EV to be rated at 250 miles per charge ... and also set the world record for straight-line SUV acceleration.

Intriguingly, this isn't the first world record Drag Times has set with a Tesla. They did it once before with the Model S P85D.

"56ca49a4b05f9d49440006ca","Sergio Hernandez","World","Apple may face an uphill climb in its latest fight with the feds over digital privacy.

The company's CEO, Tim Cook, said in a statement on its website Wednesday that Apple opposes a federal court's order to write special software so federal investigators can penetrate the passcode for an iPhone once used by Syed Farook.

See also: The FBI wants Apple to create an iPhone backdoor: Here's how it's possible

Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were the perpetrators of a shooting spree in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 2, which killed 14 people and injured 22 others. The shooters were later killed during a gunfight with police.

Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and lawyers from the Justice Department have said Farook's phone, and iPhone 5C, may contain key evidence about his communications in the weeks before the attack, but they cannot access it without Farook's passcode.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym issued the Apple order on Tuesday, after the local U.S. Attorney petitioned a federal court for Apple's help.

FBI agents have been unable to access the phone's contents because of security features built into the device's software. Those include one that forces users to wait several minutes before entering different passcodes. Another erases a decryption key necessary to access the device's data if a user enters a wrong passcode too frequently.

The judge's order instructs Apple to write custom software, called a ""Software Image File,"" to bypass these security features so the FBI can quickly test an unlimited number of passcodes until it finds the right one. Once that as-yet-uncreated software is installed on the phone, security experts say it would take no more than a day to find the code.

News of the order triggered fierce debate last week as technologists wondered whether Apple can, as a matter of technical ability, comply with the demand, while privacy advocates said engineering such software could have dangerous security implications. Legal experts said it raises constitutional questions about how far the government can go when conscripting private, third parties to assist with law enforcement.

Cook's statement, which indicated the company planned to fight the order in court, prompted the Justice Department to file a new motion on Friday, asking Pym to compel Apple to comply with her previous order.

While Apple has not responded formally, Friday's filing and records from a similar case, in a Brooklyn federal court, offer clues about how the looming legal battle may play out.

The other phone

In the Brooklyn case, the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration sought Apple's help to access an iPhone 5 belonging to Jun Feng, a Queens man charged with possessing and conspiring to sell methamphetamine in 2014. As with the San Bernardino case, the FBI obtained a search warrant to inspect Feng's phone but was unable to get past Apple's security software.

Both cases hinge on a 227-year-old statute called the All Writs Act, which serves, essentially, as a last resort for federal judges to enforce the law.

While critics have mocked the Justice Department for relying on a two-century-old statute to seek Apple's help, prosecutors have said they regularly use the AWA orders for such cases.

In fact, the San Bernardino and Brooklyn cases are just two of at least 70 instances where the government has sought AWA orders compelling Apple to help authorities access evidence on locked or encrypted smartphones, or ""target"" devices, that it manufactures and sells. A prosecutor in the Brooklyn case first revealed that figure publicly during a hearing in October.

Congress has updated the AWA several times since it first passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the country's federal court system.

""Some call it antiquated,"" said Saritha Komatireddy, the Feng prosecutor, during the October hearing. ""It's actually foundational.""

Its seminal interpretation comes from the Supreme Court's 1977 ruling in United States v. New York Telephone Co. In that case, the FBI sought help from a local telephone utility to install a pen register, a device that gathers call records, to obtain evidence of an illegal gambling operation.

The New York Telephone court sided with the FBI and helped establish a three-part test to determine when judges can issue AWA orders to force third parties to assist law enforcement. The test includes:

Whether other means exist to help achieve the government's goal,
The third party's (Apple, in the present cases) relationship to the issue-at-hand, and
Whether an AWA order would unreasonably burden the third party.

In the Apple cases, according to experts and court records, all three questions may be in play.

A last-ditch effort
Since AWA orders are a last resort, the government's requests raise key questions about whether investigators can access the evidence on locked devices — or Apple's help — in other ways.

During the October hearing in Brooklyn, the judge in that case, James Orenstein, pressed prosecutors on that issue.

""Could you subpoena or use some other form of court process — a warrant, perhaps an All Writs Act order — to have Apple disclose to you how to get the information from the phone?"" Orenstein asked.

One avenue, he suggested, was subpoenaing Apple engineers to testify before a Grand Jury about how Apple would access locked devices, essentially walking prosecutors through how to do it themselves.

""What you need is the knowhow to get to this phone,"" Orenstein said.

He also asked whether prosecutors could consult intelligence agencies, such as the National Security or Central Intelligence agencies, about methods they may have secretly developed for accessing locked devices.

Legal experts told Mashable that whether the AWA applies may be a key issue in the San Bernardino case, because Pym's order doesn't just force Apple to give agents access to its information, tools or facilities — it requires Apple to create something new altogether, which Apple has said exceeds the scope of its business.

""That's uncharted territory,"" said Valerie Barreiro, a law professor at the University of Southern California.

Relationship to target phones
Apple's relationship to the devices in question may be a murkier matter.

That issue takes its cue from United States v. Hall, a 1983 case from Virginia, where a federal court compelled Citibank to provide a fugitive's credit card records. In that case, the court authorized an AWA order because Citibank was still extending credit to the suspect.

Apple has tried to distance itself from the target phones, arguing that it merely manufactured and sold the devices.

But Feng prosecutors have argued that Apple's strict control over the devices' software means it continues to provide services long after its phones are sold, especially because Apple, technically, only leases its software to customers.

""Apple cannot reap the legal benefits of licensing its software in this manner and then later disclaim any ownership or obligation to assist law enforcement when the same software plays a critical role in thwarting execution of a search warrant,"" prosecutors wrote in a brief.

""They're definitely trying to create a public policy argument,"" Barreiro said. ""'You own and you license the software, which is then used to facilitate a criminal enterprise; You can't turn a blind eye to what is done with that [software],'""

""It's an ongoing relationship because you're not just creating a product,"" she added. ""You're creating a service and that service is ongoing, so you can't separate yourself from that.""

Apple's lawyers balked, responding in a brief that its ""licensing agreement does not establish a connection between Apple and the private data its customers store on their devices.""

Unreasonable burden
If the courts agree that Apple is the FBI's only hope and related closely enough to the target devices, there's still a third question to sort out: Whether helping the FBI would be unreasonably burdensome.

""The courts have typically considered factors such as cost and capability to determine whether or not [an AWA order] is burdensome,"" Barreiro said.

But as a leading technology company, the software's developer and one of the most cash-rich operations in the world, Apple may be hard-pressed to make its case for burden.

""I don't think they can make the argument that this is technologically prohibitive or cost-prohibitive,"" Barreiro said.

Instead, in the Brooklyn case, Apple has argued that cooperating with the FBI would burden the company by ""threaten[ing] the trust between Apple and its customers"" and ""substantially tarnish[ing] the Apple brand.""

""Public sensitivity to issues regarding digital privacy and security is at an unprecedented level,"" Apple lawyers wrote in a brief. ""This reputational harm could have a longer term economic impact.""

But Orenstein, the judge, seemed unpersuaded.

""As you have taken pains to make clear,"" he told Apple's lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, at the October hearing, ""you only break into one of these phones if you're compelled by law. Well, we all have an obligation to follow the law. So how does that imperil the trust consumers have?""

""You have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you [to fight a court order],"" Orenstein continued. ""That, I can see, imperils [consumers'] trust. But complying with an order after you fight it — how is that going to do it?""

Proving burden may be especially difficult in the San Bernardino case, since the judge gave Apple tremendous flexibility in how to comply.

Apple, Pym's order said, can either: Provide the custom software to the FBI, run the software at an Apple facility, or devise an ""alternate"" and mutually agreeable way to help agents access the phone.

""One of the things that's admirable about the court order is it's really as narrowly construed as it can be,"" Barreiro said. ""The court has attempted to make this applicable only to this phone and to give Apple an opportunity to try to find an alternate means.""

Separation of powers
News of the San Bernardino order touched off a heated debate about the precedent it may set and whether the issue should be decided in courts or through legislation.

While prosecutors argued the requested software would be uniquely tailored to Farook's phone, critics pointed out the process could be repeated for other devices in other cases.

They also worry about precedent, although AWA orders have traditionally required a case-by-case analysis and opinions from federal district judges, such as Pym and Orenstein, are not binding outside their jurisdictions.

The government has argued that, absent an explicit prohibition by Congress to use AWA orders in this way, judges are free to do so.

Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Brooklyn case, and Barreiro disagree.

""If we're going to do this, it should be through legislation,"" Barreiro said. ""Not through interpretation and not through the contorting of this act.""

In its Feng brief, the ACLU argued that a constitutional issue is also at stake. Specifically, to what extent does the Fifth Amendment allow government to conscript third parties into helping law enforcement before violating their rights to liberty?

""What the government is asking Apple to do is undermine a fundamental part of what it offers, which is secure communication,"" Esha Bhandari, a staff attorney with the ACLU, told Mashable.

""If it can no longer do that because the government has forced it to build malware, for example, that undermines its very business enterprise and what it's offering,"" she explained.

Bhandari said that until Congress gives courts or law enforcement explicit authority to forcibly enlist third parties in this way, they should not do so.

Congress has, in recent years, considered legislation that would require device-makers to build so-called ""backdoors"" and help law enforcement agencies access target devices.

Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, have indicated support for such legislation. The Obama administration had also supported such legislation, but recently shelved its plans to ""seek a legislative remedy"" on the issue.

Supporters say a solution is necessary for law enforcement to keep up with criminals as they gain access to more sophisticated technology, such as encryption, that makes it easier to hide evidence.

But privacy advocates have opposed such measures. They say backdoors would expand government's surveillance abilities and create security weaknesses exploitable by hackers and criminals. Those concerns have grown in recent years, as data breaches become more common and since Edward Snowden's revelations about mass surveillance.

In its San Bernardino filing on Friday, prosecutors accused Apple capitalizing on such fears to court public support.

""The government shares Apple's stated concern that 'information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals,'"" the continued. ""The Order at issue does not compromise that interest.""

""What is at stake,"" they said, is a ""proper, legal [judicial order] based on a finding of probable cause.""

""It does not,"" they argued, ""mean the end of privacy.""

The Ghostbusters Lego playset features the whole female cast in figurine form; we're talking Lego versions of actors Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Oh, and there's a Chris Hemsworth Lego guy thrown in for good measure.

Meanwhile, die-hard Doctor Who fans have a lot to love about the Tardis set, which is on sale now and comes with two doctors (the 11th and 12th), Clara and some monsters to fight. And for Angry Birds enthusiasts waiting for the new film to hit theaters in May, you'll now be able to catapult Lego-sized characters at piggies in real life.

Here's a closer look at the latest Lego sets making their public debut for the first time.

Noble tree-alien Groot sacrificed himself at the end of Guardians, only to return a short time later as a tiny, dancing sprout that the Internet immediately fell in love with. Now the very first promotional photo for Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 is here -- and Groot is still so tiny.

You can see him perched on his pal Drax the Destroyer's shoulder, hanging onto the muscled murderer-turned-galactic savior's ear. All five of the first movie's accidental heroes are captured in silhouette, surrounded by road cases. This picture screams: ""We're getting the band back together.""

Guardians director James Gunn tweeted the image, but it's also accompanied by an announcement from Marvel Studios that production has officially begun on Vol. 2, which is set to release on May 5, 2017.

Official Photography on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has begun. You're very welcome. pic.twitter.com/741upZ21g7
— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 17, 2016
The original lineup of the Guardians is returning: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper. They're joined by supporting players Michael Rooker (Yondu), Karen Gillan (Nebula) and Sean Gunn (Kraglin) as well as newcomers Pom Klementieff (Oldboy), Elizabeth Debicki (Everest), Chris Sullivan (The Knick) and Kurt Russell (he's Kurt f*cking Russell, folks).

Marvel hasn't officially confirmed the identities of the four new cast members, though Gunn revealed on Twitter that Klementieff is playing Mantis. The character has a long, convoluted comic book history that actually includes appearances in DC, Eclipse and Image comics, but more recent iterations of Mantis frame her as telepathic headshrinker for the Guardians team.

Little is known about the Guardians sequel beyond the fact that it will dig deeper into Peter ""Star-Lord"" Quill's personal history, specifically who his father is and why he's important. For those that don't remember, the movie version of Quill never knew his father and only has his mother's deathbed description -- that dear, old dad is actually an angel made of light -- to go on.

While this promo shot doesn't come from the movie, Groot's size in the image suggests that the sequel picks up only a short time after the events of the first movie. Of course, Groot is also a fictional tree-alien, so who really knows how long it really takes him to grow beyond his sprout size?

Chris Pratt decided to have a little fun with the promo photo's reveal on Instagram. This is one of those things that's better seen that described, soooooooo... enjoy.

"56bb65ddb05f9d266e0004bf","Chris Perkins","Tech","If you've ever wanted to prove your superior knowledge of GIFs, a new game is everything you've been waiting for.

GIF Battle, developed by New York-based app developers Postlight, lets two users battle each other using GIFs and smack talk. After one player accepts a challenge from the other over Twitter by clicking on the link, each player gets a two-minute chess clock. It counts down as you look for a GIF via the site's search engine, then pauses the moment you post it to the battle page, which instantly starts your opponent's clock.

As the battle wages on, GIFs continue to appear in the stream in succession until time runs out. The winner is whomever's GIFs get the most likes, as voted by the Internet (the initial declaration of battle goes out over Twitter, but the GIFs don't). It's a concept as silly and clever as it sounds.

See also: The History of GIFs

Postlight came up with the idea after it realized that its employees use GIFs nearly as much as they do words. If you work for a startup that uses a platform like Slack, Flowdock or Hipchat, you know what we’re talking about here. These new chat apps make sharing animated GIFs nearly effortless (Slack, for example, has built-in Giphy integration). Consequently, chatrooms otherwise dedicated to talking about work can quickly devolve into endless streams of looping images.

Postlight decided that building an app like Slack -- but exclusively for GIFs -- would be a good way for the company to experiment with new development tools and see how quickly it could ship a complete product. Its experiment soon morphed into a game.

GIF Battle is very simple, and the Twitter integration makes it easy to immediately start playing. And there's no shortage of GIFs to choose from: Competitors can search for GIFs (the site mines Giphy for images), link to a specific GIF with a URL or upload one from their personal collection.

GIF Battle is the perfect game to play with your Internet friends when you're procrastinating at work, thanks to its relatively short length. Different battles naturally take on different themes; one memorable battle included a quasi-debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fans. Another involved Postlight posting Wolf of Wall Street GIFs to poke fun at Goldman Sachs employees who attended GIF Battle's launch party. Unfortunately, although the site posts the most ""epic"" battles each week, there's no way (yet) to search the archive.

Paul Ford, co-founder of Postlight, recently wrote the much-buzzed-about mammoth Businessweek article on code. He described the GIF as ""the greatest media type"" at GIF Battle's launch party, and most attendees seemed to agree.

But what is it about the GIF that inspires such adulation?

Rise of the GIF

Naomi Baron, professor of linguistics at American University and author of ""Words on Screen: The Fate of Reading on Screen"" believes that GIFs are a natural extension of how humans have communicated for years.

""Way back in the day, people, particularly young girls, would put x's and o's for love and kisses in writing to Grandma or sometimes their parents from camp, or whatever,"" said Baron in an interview with Mashable. ""We've added stuff to our messages for quite some time.""

This human tendency to add extra visual symbols to our communications translated well to the computer, first with emoticons, then Japanese Kaomoji (¯\_(ツ)_/¯), memes, emoji as we know them today and, of course, GIFs.

Baron also believes that the rise of GIFs has much to do with the fact that humans have become used to moving images.

""We're so used to watching things move,"" Baron said. ""We have acculturated ourselves to having animated ads and  watching a lot of YouTubes. Animated GIFs are taking that same principle, but adding a communicative function.""

Within various Internet communities, GIFs can carry a very specific meaning. Think of your favorite one: to you, and perhaps your friends, the meaning of that looping image is as clear as any word in your first language. That same GIF might have an entirely different meaning within a different circle of people -- but it carries meaning either way.

GIF Battle, as Baron sees it, isn't too different from word games like crossword puzzles or Scrabble.

""We play with things that have some kind of meaning attached to them,"" said Baron. ""You can say a word is a linguistic sign that pairs together some kind of representation with some kind of meaning; GIFs do the same thing, so it's not surprising that we would play with those the way we play with more traditional expressions of meaning.""

Couple our natural tendency to gravitate towards GIFs with the increasing ease of sharing, and the game's ubiquity seems inevitable. 

In addition to the chat/collaboration platforms mentioned earlier, Tumblr integrates with Giphy, as does social media upstart Peach; Facebook finally began to support GIFs in summer 2015; and even Twitter is getting around to testing its own GIF search tool after allowing autoplay GIFs in its timeline.

GIF Battle takes the Gif-as-communication to a new high. It's as much a product of coders looking to experiment as it is the culture we live in.

See also: Can you hear that? Jaguar's 575-horsepower F-TYPE SVR is coming.

The V90 is the third Volvo in the company's new 90 series, following the XC90 and S90, and is the latest one designed under the new Volvo since its purchase by Chinese carmaker Geely. Despite its corporate parent, though, the car was designed in Sweden -- if you couldn't tell by its sensibilities.

The latest and greatest Swedish wagon rides on Volvo's new SPA (scalable platform architecture) vehicle chassis, which is powered by a family of new four-cylinder engines that Volvo spent $11 billion to develop. At the top of the V90's power range is a 410-horsepower plug-in hybrid model called the T8.

Just look at that interior. At the heart of the modern but spare elegant interior is Volvo's new SENSUS infotainment system, which has been designed to operate like a tablet with a swipe and pinch-to-zoom interface.

Granted, it's a sight more technically complicated than the 1986 240 wagon, but it's a lot safer, too. As Volvo puts it, the V90 offers ""cutting-edge Pilot Assist semi-autonomous drive technology,"" as well as large animal detection and run-off road mitigation and class-leading connectivity, including Apple CarPlay.

To get up close and personal with this beautiful wagon, though, you'll have to make your way to Geneva, Switzerland, where the V90 is making its global debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show from March 3 to 13.

I instantly related to Scout. Like her, I didn't understand a lot of what the adults around her spoke about. She was not much younger than I was. We both adored reading and both looked up to our lawyer fathers as men who knew everything. 

There followed a memorable conversation with my father about the book. In the car on the way to school, he asked what I thought the title meant -- and discussed how comparing black characters like Tom Robinson to harmless mockingbirds was actually an example of racism, even if not a malicious kind. This was, of course, years before Go Set a Watchman made Atticus' paternalistic racism clear and sparked hundreds of think pieces on the topic. 

But I was 11, and I mostly loved how Scout would fight the boys at school and how she, Jem, and Dill had adventures. I remember trying to get my best friend to read it. Instead she left it in her locker, where it get wet and the cover stained.

In the 14 years since I first read her novel, my admiration for Harper Lee has only grown. I've read the book about a dozen times, including as part of my 100 Books challenge last year. I joined my sorority in part because I heard she had been a member. 

I didn't grow up in the rural south in the 1920s and 1930s like Nelle Harper Lee. This was suburban Ohio in the 1990s. But I still connected to Scout Finch, just as countless of other people have in the 56 years since To Kill a Mockingbird was published. 

I knew her book was famous. I knew it won awards and had an equally acclaimed film adaptation. But I didn't care. Yes, Scout had to face the racism of her small town, which represented the flaws of the American justice system as a whole. Yes, the bigotry of all kinds in Maycomb taught generations of readers to put themselves in someone else's shoes, to try and understand others instead of judging them. And yes, despite his flaws, Atticus Finch was a hero for standing up for what he thought was right when it was far from the easy thing to do.

But this was also the story of a little girl and her father and her brother, her friend, her neighbors. Scout was my friend, and she also a very real part of who I was. 

Every time I read To Kill a Mockingbird I find something new to appreciate, a new way of looking at an old story. My perspective on Atticus changed as I grew up, the same way my perspective of my own parents changed. I grew to better understand the villainy of Bob Ewell, but then again to grow to pity him. And over the years, more and more, I found myself understanding Boo Radley.

It's not hyperbole to say Lee and her book helped shape the woman I am today. I've constantly tried to do as Atticus taught, to see things from other people's points of view. The loyalty that Scout and Jem have for their father and for each other colored the way I saw my own siblings and parents, coming as I did from an extended family as big as Maycomb itself. 

When my brother married into a southern family, I was grateful to have the insight of Lee's world. When I moved to New York after graduating college, I came with the knowledge that Lee herself did the same thing -- and was able to not only make her way, but change her own life and the world with what she made.

There's a lot more to say about Lee and her work. I could reiterate how I see Go Set a Watchman, last year's controversial publication, as the unedited pre-Mockingbird manuscript it is. How the film adaptation of Mockingbird is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my favorites. I could quote the book for days, both the gems of wisdom and the ridiculous lines like ""Cecil Jacobs is a big wet he-en!"" Instead, I'll take a note from Lee and keep my writing to a minimum.

After Lee died, I asked my father if he remembered why he gave me the book all those years ago. He said it was because he ""always wanted [me] to be a reader."" He certainly succeeded at that. He then added ""and because I loved you.""

The two-day protest kicked off Friday morning with clashes between riot police and Cretan farmers wielding shepherds' staffs that left 10 policemen slightly injured and smashed windows at the agriculture ministry.

Music blared from loudspeakers and protesters braving rain lit a bonfire near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the foot of parliament, while about 20 tractors parked nearby. Tents were set up in the adjacent central Syntagma Square in preparation for an all-night sit-in.

Farming associations have been blockading highways across the country with tractors for more than two weeks, forcing traffic into lengthy diversions to protest a planned overhaul of the country's troubled pension system. So far, they have refused talks with the government, insisting the pension reform plan must be repealed.

Bailout lenders are demanding that Greece scrap tax breaks for farmers and impose pension reforms that will lead to higher monthly contributions from the self-employed and salaried employees.

"56ca1e8412d2cd2b4c000847","Wolfgang Wild","Entertainment","Released in 1965, and running on unbroken release at cinemas worldwide for the next four and a half years,The Sound of Music is now the fifth highest grossing film of all time. And the story it is tells is a true one — up to a point.
The film was an adaptation of the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein II musical of the same name, which itself was based on Maria von Trapp's book The Story of the Trapp Family Singers.
The film's producer, Robert Wise, expressed very clearly to the Von Trapps that he was not making a documentary but rather a dramatic film of which all parties could feel a sense of pride.
The core of the film was true.  A 19-year-old Maria Von Trapp had indeed been in training to become a nun in a Salzburg Abbey. The Abbess sent her to be a tutor to the widowed naval commander Georg von Trapp's children.

The family became well known as The Von Trapp Family Choir, and, at around the time of the German annexation of Austria, left their homeland.

But some key differences remain.  Georg was 25 years older than Maria when they married in the late 1920s, rather than the late 1930s. And Maria was very clear about her feelings for Georg:
Between 1929 and 1939, Georg and Maria had three children together, as well as Georg's own seven children.
But it was the collapse of the bank holding the family's finances that was the spur behind their success as touring singing act, to Georg's embarrassment.
Anti-Nazi, the family did indeed flee Austria when the Nazi party sought to recruit Georg to the German navy.  But they did not walk across the mountains to Switzerland — a journey of some 200 miles.  Rather, they caught a train to Italy and then on to the United States.  Their Austrian home became Heinrich Himmler's HQ.
Georg died in 1947 in Vermont.  The Von Trapp Family singers continued for the next decade before finally disbanding in 1957 - though not before having featured on an Elvis Presley record.
Maria died in 1987, aged 82.  But, as many of the film's fans know, she can be seen for a moment in the film.  Maria and two of her daughters walk across an archway as Julie Andrews sing ""I must stop these doubts, all these worries / If I don't, I just know I'll turn back."" in the song ""I Have Confidence.""",0.0777380952380952,0.388273809523809,"http://mashable.com/2016/02/21/true-story-sound-of-music/",418,8,21,21,8,12,0,"2016-02-21T20:30:35+00:00",2528,3,"The true story behind 'The Sound of Music'",0.116666666666667,0.583333333333333,"Entertainment,Movies,History,Music,musicals,Retronaut,The Sound of Music,Uncategorized","hot"

All four members of the band and their manager were killed in a car crash in Sweden Saturday night after their vehicle crashed through a barrier and into a canal near Stockholm.

Tributes flooded in for Kris Leonard, River Reeves, Tomas Lowe, Jack Dakin and their manager Craig Tarry and before long fans were suggesting people should buy single ""Swings & Waterslides"" to pay their respects.

The suggestion has been echoed by the Warrington Guardian, a paper in the band members' home town.

The band's label announced in a statement that ""everyone here is in a state of total shock and sorrow"" and said that proceeds from their latest single, ""Boys That Sing,"" will go to the families of the band members and their manager.

The cut-off point for this week's chart is midnight on Thursday, with the final position that ""Swings & Waterslides"" reaches confirmed on Friday.

Viola Beach's music is available on the iTunes store.

"56ba83e512d2cd06c300009b","Lagunitas","Entertainment","When was the last time your town had something to be truly excited about?

Not some ribbon cutting ceremony at the new public library or a cheesy ticker-tape parade to celebrate a local reality-show contestant. No, we're talking full-blown, four-alarm, tell-your-grandkids-about-it-someday exciting. 

Few occasions can rightfully claim the title. However, we're willing to bet that if you won a contest that brought a massive Lagunitas party to a venue in your town -- complete with some of your favorite musical artists and an endless supply of tasty brews -- it would be the only thing people could talk about. 

Those are the stakes. And if you want a shot at bringing an all-out rager to your town, Google Maps can lend a helping hand. 

The weirdest road-tripping party can find its way to your zip code

The event (in case it wasn't obvious): The Lagunitas CouchTrippin' Tour. 

If you're new to CouchTrippin', the basic idea is every year, Lagunitas roadtrips to Texas and sets up spectacles of music and beer along the way. Then, when the trip finally reaches Austin, the brewer throws a party of epic proportions.  

At the end of the Austin party, the whole event gets packed back up and heads home. 

But this year will be different. Lagunitas wants to keep the party going by sending the road show to a venue in your town.

All you have to do is submit your home address into a contest form powered by Google Maps. Once you complete your entry, a custom video will give you a quick glimpse of the route to your neighborhood-- from notable road-trip landmarks to a tasty tour of the Lagunitas brewery -- and trust us, it's wild. 

Of course, we don't want to ruin all of the surprises, but there are definitely laser-shooting armadillos involved. 

So what are you waiting for? Check out the route from Austin to your town and enter for the chance to see the CouchTrippin' caravan make a pit-stop at a venue near you.

You'll be doing yourself and your town a huge favor. 

Just think about it: What town wouldn't want a truckload of fresh beer and a once-in-a-lifetime party? We sure can't think of any (not counting a handful of weird towns from movies that we're pretty sure don't exist anyway).

Identified only as Yang, the inebriated man was caught on security cam footage getting into a tussle with a friend outside of a KTV lounge before launching into an airborne flying kick towards the elevator's metal doors. As a result, one of the doors broke off its hinge and came loose, reported Sina.

While turning back to survey the damage he had caused, Yang took a step forward and to the horror of onlookers, fell through the broken door and down the elevator shaft. Four floors down to be exact.

Following the incident, staff from the KTV lounge immediately called the police and Yang was rushed to a nearby hospital. Fortunately for Yang, he survived the fall and is now recovering from a broken left leg.

Chinese reports quoted Yang's uncle, who said he works at a local restaurant and had patronised the KTV lounge with his colleagues after work to celebrate the Lunar New Year.

"56c78958b05f9d1f420000c3","Chris Taylor","Entertainment","It's a peculiarly 20th century phenomenon: the one-and-done novelist, whose fame was as much about their mystery -- retired from writing, retired from the media -- as it was about the quality of their work. 

Now that the world has lost both Harper Lee and J.D. Salinger, now that we're in an age where every author is expected to promote themselves constantly on social media, we may never see their likes again.

(Yes, the famously reclusive author Thomas Pynchon, 78, is still with us. But he's also still writing, publishing his most recent work in 2013, and even voiced himself in an episode of The Simpsons. By Lee and Salinger's standards, that's like doing cabaret in the middle of Times Square.) 

Lee, who died Friday at the age of 89, didn't meet the dictionary definition of a recluse. At least until a stroke incapacitated her in 2009, she was accessible to friends and neighbors in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, where she was known simply as Nelle. 

But she was a media recluse, refusing all interviews and speaking requests after To Kill a Mockingbird became globally famous in 1960. ""It's better to be silent than a fool,"" she once told the Alabama Academy of Honor in a typically polite turn-down. 

See also: 'Go Set a Watchman': Might Harper Lee actually be trolling us all?

More importantly, she was also a literary recluse, never writing anything that saw publication after Mockingbird. (Go Set a Watchman, essentially a first draft of Mockingbird released by Lee's lawyer in still-murky circumstances last year, doesn't count). 

There were rumors of a second Lee novel, ""The Long Goodbye"", but that appears to have stalled after Mockingbird's fame became apparent. Writing one of the greatest and bestselling novels of the century your first time out of the gate can put a real crimp in your follow-up plans. 

Lee did write at least four pages of a true crime novel to be called ""The Reverend,"" confirmed by this fascinating New Yorker report. But by the end of Lee's life, her lawyer was reportedly denying that the legal materials on which ""The Reverend"" was to be based were even in Lee's possession.

Meanwhile, Salinger stopped publishing his work around the same time Lee arrived on the scene. He had a more prodigious output -- 13 short stories and novellas in addition to his one slim and shining novel, The Catcher in the Rye. He gave his last interview much later, in 1980, though that one may have been conducted under false pretenses. 

Salinger, who died in 2010 at the age of 91, was inherently more reclusive than Lee. He holed up in the town of Cornish, New Hampshire, and became enraged even when locals wanted to shake hands or snap a picture. And that, of course, just intrigued us all the more. The New York Times called him ""almost equally famous for having elevated privacy to an art form."" 

Salinger and Lee were uneasy when it came to their novel's fame. Both radiated a sense that the great mass of the reading public had missed the point. Salinger was aghast at the abortive attempts to film Catcher in the Rye (and when you consider that it may at one point have starred Jerry Lewis as Holden Caulfield, you can see his point). 

See also: Three Out-of-Print J.D. Salinger Stories Are Now Legally Republished

As for Lee, it's entirely possible she was cognizant of how bad Watchman was, and wanted it released to help tear down the cloying myth that Atticus Finch had become. 

In any case, that endlessly fascinating trope -- reclusive one-time novelist, famous for being afraid of their own fame, who may yet reveal a new work of genius -- is dying out. It was possible in the 20th century, in that stretch of time when mass media was ascendant, but before everyone even in small towns had a cameraphone and access to Instagram. (By the time the social media revolution arrived, Salinger and Lee were both infirm shut-ins.) 

Can you imagine that trope happening again? First of all you'd have to have a work of literature as controversial as Catcher or as perfectly fitting to the spirit of the times as Mockingbird. 

While there are many great novels in the 21st century, none quite rise to that level. We don't ban books for using the word ""goddamn"" any more -- that was a big part of Catcher's fame -- and it's no longer revolutionary to have a teenage protagonist declare the world is full of phonies. 

Meanwhile, the lessons in human decency and racial profiling that Mockingbird taught can be found in multiple media. Even within the book world, we seem to prefer to take our lessons from nonfiction more than fiction. Perhaps the closest thing to a 21st century Mockingbirdso far is the enormous international success last year of Between the World and Me -- and far from becoming a recluse, Ta-Nehesi Coates is becoming a comic book writer.

The pressure for authors to promote their work is greater than ever. Attention spans are shrinking, quite literally, and writers have to fight to be heard above the noise of the Internet and the golden age of television. Without exception, every U.S. publishing house urges every writer to have a strong social media presence. If they can live-tweet an event related to their book in some tangential way, so much the better.

If an author had a huge hit novel then decided to deliberately drop out, delete their Facebook and Twitter accounts and move to a small town -- well, we'd either accuse them of staging a stunt that they could later write about (""I'm avoiding social media"" is already a trope in itself), or we'd simply shrug, forget about them fifteen minutes later and move on to the next big thing.

Even if we were interested in pursuing them, the pursuit would be child's play in a world where we are all paparazzi. When Facebook tags pictures of people who aren't even on Facebook, it is almost impossible to be a Salinger or a Pynchon, preventing the press from getting their hands on anything but grainy old photos of yourself in your youth. 

(Almost impossible, but not quite -- witness Jonathan Hirshon, a former Apple PR pro who has successfully kept photos of himself off the Internet for the last 20 years. Perhaps he should consider writing a novel?) 

So RIP, Harper Lee -- a woman who not only surprised and delighted us with her only novel, but intrigued and fascinated us with her dedication to not writing another.

"56bca3efb05f9d198200062f","Yohana Desta","Entertainment","CORRECTION: Meryl Streep’s “We’re all Africans, really” comment was a direct response to a question about Arab and African films, not a response to questions about the Berlinale Film Festival’s all white jury, as the article and headline originally suggested. A recording of the panel shows that Streep’s original comments were misrepresented in subsequent reports. 

At the panel, a reporter from Egypt spoke about how the festival had a film “representing Tunisia, the Arab world and Africa in the main competition” and followed that up with a question for Streep: ""How do you see this part of the world? And is it easy for you to understand that culture? And are you following any of the Arab movies?”

This was Streep’s response.

“Yes, in fact I’ve just seen a film called Theeb, which I loved. I saw Timbuktu recently … I don’t know very much about, honestly, about the Middle East, and yet I’ve played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures. The thing that I notice is that we’re all, there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture. And, after all, we’re all from Africa originally. We’re all Berliners, we’re all Africans, really.""

Our original story appears below. The post first appeared with the headline Meryl Streep's diversity: 'We're all Africans, really' 

Ask Meryl Streep about diversity, and she'll give you a rather curious answer. 

""We're all Africans, really,"" the three-time Oscar winner said on Thursday, in response to an inquiry about the all-white panel at the Berlin International Film Festival. Streep is serving as the festival's jury president this year. 

See also: Latino, Asian and Native American actors aren't at the Oscars, either 

She added that the festival is determined to include ""all genders, races, ethnicities, religions."" Its 2016 jury is made up of seven white people: actor Lars Eidinger, British film critic Nick James, French photographer Brigitte Lacombe, British actor Clive Owen, Italian actress Alba Rohrwacher and Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska.

""This jury is evidence that at least women are included and in fact dominate this jury, and that's an unusual situation in bodies of people who make decisions,"" Streep said. ""So I think the Berlinale is ahead of the game.""

An Egyptian reporter also asked Streep if she ""understood films from the Arab world and North Africa,"" according to AP. Though she doesn't know much about the area, she says, ""I've played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures.""

""There is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture, and after all we're all from Africa originally,"" she said. ""Berliners, we're all Africans, really.""

Okay, Meryl. 

Diversity has been a major issue in Hollywood as of late, especially concerning this year's Academy Awards. Only white actors were nominated for Oscars, with mostly white nominees in other categories as well. Celebrities like Lupita Nyong'o and Ava DuVernay spoke out against the nominations, while Jada Pinkett and Will Smith vowed to boycott the awards show altogether.

Rowling's publicists on Wednesday. It sent the Potter fandom into a real frenzy of excitement to step back into the world of the Boy Who Lived and see where his life takes him.However, there are other curmudgeons out there who think that enough is enough. They say the wizarding world stories have all been told and that Rowling should probably spend her time on other pursuits. SEE ALSO: Accio, wand! The 10 most popular 'Harry Potter' spells revealedIn the spirit of dueling, we put together one die-hard Harry fan who wants Pottermore, Andrea Romano, and one lover of the books but hater of that ""Cursed Child,"" Peter Allen Clark. With wands at the ready, they tried to capture that winged snitch of truth through the art of debate.J.K. Rowling can do literally anything she wantsAndrea: I am not joking. She has more money than the Queen. She wrote a series about boy wizards and yet we still listen to her when she tweets about foreign policy. If she wanted to overthrow the monarchy, the papacy and all the world leaders and dub herself Super-Pope-Queen-Emperor-President of the world, I’m pretty sure we’d let her because the collective Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook followers that she has makes up could make a small army (a Dumbledore’s Army, if you will). And we’d fight to the death for our Super-Pope-Queen-Emperor-President of the world. Have you ever tried to start an argument about Harry Potter on reddit? It’ll never end. I had a fight about wizard money on Twitter and it took up half my morning. That was just with one person. We can’t stop, and it’s because we are loyal. And she knows it.Peter: I disagree. Her status only means that she should take greater care of what she releases into the world. Let’s be clear: This is not a new book. This is an adaptation of a stage play. Not even that. It’s just the script. This is not a full-fledged return to the wizarding world. This is dialogue. Nothing against theater, but it does limit the story one wants to tell. Live theater doesn’t really allow for many, say, spells, creatures, potion effects or any of the many, many outlandish things that happen in HP’s world.Let’s be clear: this is not a new book. This is an adaptation of a stage play.I was moderately fine with Rowling having wizards treading the boards, even though it means she lied about being down with the series. I thought it was like a little spinoff experiment, but unveiling it as ‘the eighth Harry Potter’ book just seems very tacky. As they say in every Spider Man reboot, “With great power, comes great responsibility.” Rowling should learn by Uncle Ben’s words and treat her extremely influential position with great care. That does not include just throwing out a book just because, ‘Hey, I’ve wrote a play. Might as well make it another book!’ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Do you know what happened to Uncle Ben when Peter Parker ignored him, Andrea? He died. J. K. Rowling is killing Uncle Ben. RebuttalAndrea: Are you saying stage plays are not books? Because I have a DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY of theater nerds who would disagree. Who says a stage play is limiting? Spells, creatures, potions -- all of these can be described in a script. Let’s go back to how scripting began, shall we? In the old days (let’s say, during the Greeks and the Elizabethans), scripts were bare-bones (kind of like the way you’re imagining right now). Only dialogue. It was when the first production (first production EVER to produce said play) brought in a dramaturg that things like room descriptions, blocking or even character descriptions were added in. BY the dramaturg. Who is to say Cursed Child won’t have these details added in? And I don’t know about you, I consider a play to be literature. HELLO SHAKESPEARE.On that note, we want J.K. to keep goingAndrea: You have an unpopular opinion here, Peter. I’m sorry. But we love our beautiful moon goddess J.K. Rowling and we must have more of her precious, precious words to consume or else we will shrivel up and die. As long as J.K. is here, we want her to speak. Why else would we pay such close attention to her Twitter account?There are people on this Earth still walking around because of her words.Fact of the matter is, her series touched millions of people who related to her characters. Some people would go so far as so say her books saved their lives. THEIR LIVES, Peter! Why wouldn’t you want more of that? There are people on this Earth still walking around because of her WORDS. That is profound. And who knows how many more people she can touch with even more material. Her books are like a warm blanket, and blankets are even better when they get bigger and fluffier. We do that by keeping the world alive.Peter: Nope. First, she lied. While she did hint at more books, she explicitly told Daniel Radcliffe that there would be no further books with Harry Potter. She lied to him, she lied to all of us. How can we trust her with anything at this point? Second, many people want her to stop. Her Twitter usage has become the bane of everyone writing entertainment news. “J. K. tweeted again,” someone will say. Everyone then groans. Third, the sad fact of the matter is that very few artists can duplicate their creative genius time and time again. People age. Inspiration fails. Stories grow thin and repetitive.  I am very glad that Harry Potter meant so much to the people it touched. Her writing another book does not take that away. Rather it has the high probability of missing the high mark set by seven other books. Did you see The Who’s performance during the 2010 Super Bowl? Did you see seasons 5-9 of The Office? Did you watch TRON: Legacy? It’s better to burn out than fade away, and more times than not, it’s better to let a cohesive body of work alone. RebuttalAndrea: But Cursed Child isn’t only the work of J.K. Rowling. It is also written by Jack Thorne and John Tiffany. Just like the Star Wars series, it’s not solely resting in her glorious, beautiful hands. Other people (but not TOO MANY) are bringing their creativity to it. And I’ll give you that there are too many “J.K. tweeted” stories. But that’s our (the media’s) problem. Not her’s.The Wizarding World is still unfinishedAndrea: What happens when you stop asking questions? You die, Peter. You just die. Harry Potter fans are an inquisitive bunch and we can’t just read a book, put it back on the shelf and go, “Welp, that was fun.” No. We must delve deeper. What is up with wizarding money? It makes no sense. As much as we predict and assume about it, we can never be right. This is how she quiets our troubled minds.Never. Not until she tells us we’re right. And that can’t happen without more books. Or an encyclopedia. Or just MORE material to consume and fill our brains with. This is how she quiets our troubled minds. Is your mind not troubled by this? Harry Potter was rich and detailed, but with every detail, you must answer for 10 more details. It’s a never-ending cycle. J.K. Rowling will be working for the rest of her life.Peter: Where does that end? Do you want any number of books on economics dealing with how the Gringotts Bank indirectly fueled backhanded dealings at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary, ultimately leading to Hagrid’s hatching of Norbert? Actually, that sounds kind of cool.Crap. RebuttalAndrea: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA!Peter: But no, a line has to be drawn with the questions. It is an author’s responsibility to tell a story, not to give an audience every single answer to every single question they have (even though that seems like what Rowling does every day on Twitter). Perhaps other authors could write wizarding world books similar to the Star Wars fandom. But the story of Harry Potter had an ending. It’s over. Stories should end. And this series already did.The Epilogue in Book 7 suckedAndrea: End of point. We need a do-over.Peter: Yes, Andrea, it was very, very bad. But that’s not why we’re here.Could that not have been the first sign that Rowling’s grasp on her Harry Potter creativity has slipped? Might she be tuning up to join The Who on the stage of the 2010 Super Bowl halftime show?But more pointedly, that’s life. Stories end in unconvincing, dumb ways. Even though I gnashed my teeth while reading it, it took nothing away from my sincerely great time reading the previous works.Let stories live. They don’t need to be updated, amended or expanded. Every attempt at elongating Harry Potter past its already voluminous size just smells like a cheap cash-in. RebuttalAndrea: Yes, it is why we’re here. We should always strive for perfection (because this is fiction, not life) and we were left with something disappointing. It shouldn’t end there. It wasn’t a sign that she slipped, it was a sign that it just wasn’t the right time to end it.Nothing is newAndrea: Even Shakespeare recycled old Greek plays, updated them a little, and slapped his name on them, OK? There is nothing new or original. Everything is just a different or updated version of something else. Or a reboot. Or a sequel. Even Harry Potter is an archetypical story. So why not do a continuation of it, if it’s something you love? It’s that better than seeing a remake of a classic movie that didn’t need to be remade? They remade Psycho, and it sucked. Did that need to happen? No. This is a BRAND NEW book, that happens to be set in a universe we are familiar with. Does that make it unoriginal? Not to us.Peter: Do you know what would be new, Andrea? An artist sticking to their word and understanding when it’s time to let a project continue on without adding to it. That would be something new. That would be something brave and new and Rowling will never do it. If she’s such a fan of recycling, go out and recycle something else. There are plenty of genres — military fiction, hard sci-fi, cook books, Penthouse letters. Go, Rowling. Do something else.Rebuttal Andrea: She has, did you read The Casual Vacancy?Our economy demands itAndrea: Open your eyes! Like it or not, we live in a capitalist society, and capitalism demands more Harry Potter -- because it drives commerce. J.K. Rowling can express her creativity all she wants and makes money off of it -- that’s good for her. But also, Harry Potter fans spend their hard earned cash to buy REAL BOOKS (hardback books even, from REAL BOOK STORES, not AMAZON) to  put that money back into the economy. A lot of Harry Potter fans are also book store lovers. We’re not going to buy Cursed Child on a damn e-reader. Come on. We’re helping out small businesses here. Don’t you want to help the small businesses? Who’s side are you on?Peter: Print book sales are actually up in the past few years, even without the help of Rowling pushing Potter on the precious muggles of the world. So, I think mom and pop are doing pretty well with their stores.And like you said in your first point, Rowling has more money than all religions’ gods combined. So, she certainly doesn’t need any more of those sweet galleons lining her sable-lined pockets. Our economy needs innovation.Our economy needs innovation. It needs reinvention. Do you know what happens to companies that don’t find new ways to sell themselves to the public? They fail. Apple didn’t put out the iPod and think, ‘We’re good! Nothing more needed!’ ... No, it carved out new product lines, new markets, new inventions. Learn from Apple, Rowling. RebuttalAndrea: The only way to help Mom and Pop stores to continue their upswing is with big pushes like this. To YOUR point: we can’t just leave well enough alone. Reading is fun!Andrea: Another tidbit about HP fans: we love to read! Reading is our jam! And J.K. Rowling gives us fat stacks of books to lug around on trains, planes and automobiles that will keep us occupied for hours (or at least a weekend, because we are RAVENOUS BEASTS who must finish the books IMMEDIATELY). If you’re not catching my drift, I will defer you to this man.Peter: I mean, I can’t really argue with this, despite the ‘ravenous beasts’ joke. I love reading and I want everyone to have new and great things to read. I just worry, worry, worry that if we go back to the Harry Potter well, we will only pull up an empty bucket.RebuttalAndrea: There’s nothing wrong with reading more material from a rich, detailed universe that is creative and special and we enjoy.

"56bdd080b589e44554000252","Chris Taylor","Entertainment","Time travel is serious business. Since it is a fundamentally absurd and impossible phenomenon (OK, physicists, impossible without ridiculous amounts of energy), writers tend to expend ridiculous amounts of energy explaining how their characters go back or forward. 

Fourth-dimensional fiction is littered with TARDISes and flux capacitors and all manner of time machines, going back to H.G. Wells’ original whirligig. Even The Time Traveler’s Wife, whose eponymous protagonist bounced dangerously around his own lifetime, spent pages agonizing over the mystery of how the trick was done.

That’s why Every Anxious Wave, published this week and written by newcomer novelist Mo Daviau, is a refreshing if sometimes baffling addition to the genre. Its narrator, washed-up rock guitarist Karl Bender, just sort of finds a wormhole in his closet and falls into it, briefly revisiting one of his favorite rock shows, casual as Alice going down her rabbit hole. 

Stephen King's recent time travel novel 11.22.63 similarly relies on a wormhole in a closet, but that wormhole only takes you back to 1960 and has a heck of a lot of rules. Daviau's wormhole has no clear rules, apparently changes its mind about whether you can change history, and is later reconstituted in a toilet. 

A few paragraphs in, with zero technical jargon, Karl's best friend Wayne has just sort of figured out how to connect the wormhole to his computer. He’s got it hooked up to a database of rock band performances throughout history, and they set up a nice little business transporting punters back to the show of their choice. The Sex Pistols’ first gig, Blondie at CBGB, any Dead show you care to name. It’s all up for grabs. 

There’s a tiny bit of science about Einstein-Rosen bridges when a physicist named Lena enters the picture, and a diagram of causality loops when Karl accidentally changes Lena's entire life, but otherwise this is a total punk rock time travel novel -- almost the kind of thing you can imagine Nick Hornby (High Fidelity) writing if he ever got into science fiction. 

The book is punk rock not just in the sense that it revolves around a lot of obscure, alternative and loud bands -- the title is a lyric from an obscure song by the equally obscure group Sebadoh, which should give you a sense of the kind of musical sandbox we're playing in here -- but also in the sense that it doesn’t care about narrative convention. Any narrative convention. 

It’s a book that revels in its rough edges. It feels like the equivalent of a writer playing three chords in her garage, and that alone is a joyful encouragement to all of us: just write, dammit.  

In fact, it comes as no surprise to learn that Every Anxious Wave began life as an award-winning student project at the University of Michigan. It has that student-y insouciance to it, as if the novelist is constantly curling her lip and daring you to challenge any detail of so flagrantly ridiculous a premise. Yet there’s also a light touch here, and the whole thing plays out as a very Kurt Vonnegut-style comedy. You’ll whip through its 275 pages very quickly. 

Like Vonnegut’s best work, the book is whimsical and has a beating heart. It is, of course, using the time travel premise in the service of nailing a particular emotion – nostalgia -- and the very human desire to change things that went wrong in our past, as well as in the past. 

And then, as Vonnegut did, it reminds us that no matter what we do, life intrudes and throws you for a loop –- by, in this case, hurling a very large asteroid at the Earth. 

The catalyst that sets the story in motion is Wayne’s urgent need to use the wormhole to prevent John Lennon’s assassination at the hands of Mark Chapman in 1980. This is such a critical moment in our cultural history that I’m surprised more fictional time travelers haven't attempted to fix it. For years we’ve been fixated on the conundrum of whether to kill Hitler (thanks for reviving that old chestnut, New York Times) and whether to stop the Kennedy assassination (thanks again, Stephen King). 

But what about preventing the death of one of the greatest musicians and activists of our age? Karl is dead set against it; he just wants to use the wormhole for narrow purposes of musical appreciation. Wayne just has a hunch the world would be better with Lennon in it.  

Alas, the great ""Lennon lives"" novel has yet to be written, because Wayne is accidentally diverted to Manhattan a thousand years pre-Beatles. Karl and Lena have to team up to bring him back, but their mission is constantly complicated by a number of factors. There's Karl's landlord, a sleazy and closeted guy who starts a romance with Freddie Mercury after traveling back to a Queen show in 1979. Then there's the constant temptation to use the wormhole every time you want to take a break and go see, say, an Elliott Smith show in 1997. 

Karl and Lena's own romance is kindled after they find a shared appreciation for Smith, which also refuses to adhere to any of the rules of romantic fiction. They're both suffering from different kinds of depression. Lena struggles with negative body issues. She also keeps changing as Karl accidentally meddles in her earlier life, and their adopted daughter shows up from the future. 

The whole novel teeters on the brink of being a glorious mess, especially once Karl reluctantly reunites with his former bandmate. You may find it frustrating that the characters' motivations keep changing, and that no one seems to be doing anything about the asteroid hurtling toward Earth that will, we find out from voyages into the future, kill millions. Preventing that might be slightly more important than preventing Lennon's assassination. 

But this isn't just about subverting every anxious expectation. This is, at root, a novel about how we find things we weren't looking for, and that our best efforts to fix things often mess them up even more, but that it somehow turns out okay anyway. 

As Lennon himself put it: Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. Turns out that's true for everyone, even for time travelers.

The 27th largest diamond in the world was discovered in Angola, one of the world's top diamond producing regions, according to a statement by the Australian Stock Exchange.  It is the biggest diamond found in the region.

Lucapa Diamond Company, an Australian company, along with partner companies Endiama and Rosas & Pétalas, announced the sensational discovery of the whopping 404.2 carat diamond on Tuesday. 

Endiama Chairman Antonio Carlos Sumbula said it was a huge milestone in the development of the Angolan diamond mining industry. 

“We are delighted to have recovered the biggest diamond ever found in Angola — it is a significant day for our country, our diamond industry and for the Lulo Diamond Project,"" he said in the statement. 

Lucapa chairman Miles Kennedy told ABC News he was proud of the high-quality white diamond discovery. He estimated its value could be as high as $20 million. 

""The results today are a wonderful vindication of eight years of pretty hard work,"" he said. ""It's the biggest diamond ever recorded from the country of Angola and it's the biggest diamond ever recovered by an Australian diamond miner.

""We're not used to valuing 400-carat diamonds, but if we look at other diamonds slightly less weight than this, you're looking in the order of $20 million.""

"56c513b297b2f85437000127","Karissa Bell","Tech","While most tech companies are staying silent as the encryption debate heats up once more in the wake of a judge ordering Apple to hack a mass shooter's iPhone, a handful have come out in support of the company.

WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum emphatically backed Apple CEO Tim Cook after he lambasted the request Wednesday as Google CEO Sundar Pichai took a more cautious approach, although he did echo Cook's sentiment about a ""troubling precedent.""

The controversy over a so-called iPhone backdoor came after a judge told Apple on Tuesday to help the FBI hack into the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook, who killed 14 in December. The company previously said it was unable to do so. 

Cook fired back saying he would challenge the ruling as it sets a ""dangerous precedent"" that could put all iPhone users' data at risk.

See also: Tim Cook: Building a backdoor into the iPhone is 'too dangerous'

Though Cook's letter inspired impassioned responses on both sides, tech companies so far appear to be reluctant to take an official position on the mater -- even those that have previously advocated for strong encryption. 

Google's CEO, meanwhile, called Cook's response ""important"" on Twitter and suggested more debate may be necessary.

1/5 Important post by @tim_cook. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users’ privacy— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

2/5 We know that law enforcement and intelligence agencies face significant challenges in protecting the public against crime and terrorism— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

3/5 We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

4/5 But that’s wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

5/5 Looking forward to a thoughtful and open discussion on this important issue— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

Pichai's comments came after privacy advocate Edward Snowden and others criticized Google's lack of response earlier via Twitter.

This is the most important tech case in a decade. Silence means @google picked a side, but it's not the public's. https://t.co/mi5irJcr25— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 17, 2016

WhiteHat Security founder Jeremiah Grossman also noted the significance of Apple's position and what it would mean for Google to offer its support on the issue. 

Today would be the perfect day for Sundar Pichai (Google, CEO) to back up Tim Cook (Apple, CEO).— Jeremiah Grossman (@jeremiahg) February 17, 2016

A company with $200 billion in cash taking the side of people’s security and privacy. That’s something to think about.— Jeremiah Grossman (@jeremiahg) February 17, 2016

But Google is far from the only company taking a cautious approach to the debate. Other public and private tech companies contacted by Mashable either didn't respond or declined to comment on Tuesday's ruling or Apple's response. As with the debate that sprung up in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, Silicon Valley seems to be reluctant to publicly discuss their security policies in the context of current events. As others have pointed out, there is some debate over whether Tuesday's court order constitutes a backdoor, which may be complicating the position of some companies.

One notable exception is WhatsApp's Koum, who said he ""couldn't agree more"" with Cook's letter. ""I have always admired Tim Cook for his stance on privacy and Apple's efforts to protect user data and couldn't agree more with everything said in their Customer Letter today,' he wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday. ""We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake.""

It's not clear if Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, shares Koum's opinion; the company didn't respond to Mashable's request for comment. 

Elsewhere, Box CEO Aaron Levie noted on Twitter that Cook's response shows how ""serious"" Apple is about encryption but stopped short of offering support for either side. 

If there were any lingering doubts about how serious Apple was about encryption, they just put those to rest. https://t.co/llu3rx0rnV— Aaron Levie (@levie) February 17, 2016

Encryption has been a hot-button topic in Silicon Valley for some time. More than 75 tech companies and security experts signed an open letter last May urging President Barack Obama to support strong encryption. Twitter also joined Dropbox, Mozilla, Reddit and dozens of other tech companies in signing a letter last September with a similar request. 

""The government should not erode the security of our devices or applications, pressure companies to keep and allow government access to our data, mandate implementation of vulnerabilities or backdoors into products, or have disproportionate access to the keys to private data,"" the letter said.

The film was an adaptation of the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein II musical of the same name, which itself was based on Maria von Trapp's book The Story of the Trapp Family Singers.
The film's producer, Robert Wise, expressed very clearly to the Von Trapps that he was not making a documentary but rather a dramatic film of which all parties could feel a sense of pride.
The core of the film was true.  A 19-year-old Maria Von Trapp had indeed been in training to become a nun in a Salzburg Abbey. The Abbess sent her to be a tutor to the widowed naval commander Georg von Trapp's children.

The family became well known as The Von Trapp Family Choir, and, at around the time of the German annexation of Austria, left their homeland.

But some key differences remain.  Georg was 25 years older than Maria when they married in the late 1920s, rather than the late 1930s. And Maria was very clear about her feelings for Georg:
Between 1929 and 1939, Georg and Maria had three children together, as well as Georg's own seven children.
But it was the collapse of the bank holding the family's finances that was the spur behind their success as touring singing act, to Georg's embarrassment.
Anti-Nazi, the family did indeed flee Austria when the Nazi party sought to recruit Georg to the German navy.  But they did not walk across the mountains to Switzerland — a journey of some 200 miles.  Rather, they caught a train to Italy and then on to the United States.  Their Austrian home became Heinrich Himmler's HQ.
Georg died in 1947 in Vermont.  The Von Trapp Family singers continued for the next decade before finally disbanding in 1957 - though not before having featured on an Elvis Presley record.
Maria died in 1987, aged 82.  But, as many of the film's fans know, she can be seen for a moment in the film.  Maria and two of her daughters walk across an archway as Julie Andrews sing ""I must stop these doubts, all these worries / If I don't, I just know I'll turn back."" in the song ""I Have Confidence.""",0.0777380952380952,0.388273809523809,"http://mashable.com/2016/02/21/true-story-sound-of-music/",418,8,21,21,8,12,0,"2016-02-21T20:30:35+00:00",2528,3,"The true story behind 'The Sound of Music'",0.116666666666667,0.583333333333333,"Entertainment,Movies,History,Music,musicals,Retronaut,The Sound of Music,Uncategorized","hot"
"56c5c2e497b2f8543700067b","Elizabeth Pierson","World","I was sitting in a taxi heading back to my hotel in Copacabana after a day touring the streets of Rio de Janeiro, when an ad came on the radio and I heard the words “Zika” and “mosquito” a few times. The cab driver chuckled lightly to himself and looked back at me in the rear-view mirror. We made eye contact, he saw I caught those few words, and he laughed again.

It was the fourth day of my trip, and this was the first mention of Zika.

The Zika virus started gaining international attention last month, after spreading from Brazil to other countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. The World Health Organization declared the Zika outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern."" It’s only the fourth time the WHO has declared a public health emergency, after the Ebola outbreak and polio resurgence in 2014, and H1N1 swine flu in 2009.

But from what I saw in my 10-day trip to Brazil, it seemed no one told the people in Rio.

Zika isn’t a new virus, but has garnered recent international attention because of an outbreak in northeastern Brazil, a region relatively distant from where I was traveling.

Zika virus is suspected of causing microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with a small head and an underdeveloped brain. Beyond this possible risk, symptoms are mild, usually just resulting in fever, joint pain and rashes. There is also budding evidence of a connection to Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis. But prevention and attention has focused primarily on pregnant women: The Centers for Disease Controlissued a warning, telling pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika-affected countries.

I initially wasn’t super concerned about the virus -- but headlines about the potential danger eventually caught my attention. 

I almost canceled my trip. A week before I was supposed to leave, when everyone was talking to me about the virus and every news outlet was blaring “ZIKA ZIKA ZIKA!” in my face, I panicked. As a woman in my mid twenties -- prime childbirth age, for some -- I was wary. I suddenly found myself contemplating my future children. Would they be at risk? Was it a chance I was willing to take? 

But I boarded my plane in New York City -- with multiple cans of DEET packed in my luggage -- anticipating that I would trade a Zika virus infection for an incredible vacation.

And after I touched down in Brazil, I realized I made the right choice. Not only did I not see any warnings for Zika in Rio de Janeiro or Florianopolis -- the two locations of my vacation -- but I also didn’t see many mosquitos in general, Zika-carrying or otherwise. 

Sunblock and beers were at the front of store displays, while bug sprays were tucked away in the back. I didn’t see a single mosquito net -- like the one I slept under in Africa for malaria fears -- or any warning signs. People gathered in flocks at outdoor cafes, street parties and on the beaches -- even in places where still waters provide excellent breeding ground for mosquitos. 

From a gringa's perspective, it seemed Zika was not on Brazilians’ minds, and it certainly wasn't disrupting their lifestyle. The raging nightlife in the Lagoa neighborhood in Florianopolis by a notoriously stagnant lake carried on. People were still sleeping with windows open to let in the cool summer breeze at night.

Of course, Brazil is massive, comparable in size to the United States, and the most affected areas were more than 1,400 miles away from where I was.

“Nationally, people are concerned that babies are being born with microcephaly, but there must be much more talk in the most affected areas,” said my friend Ellie, an American who has been living in Florianopolis for more than two years. “And Carnival helped to mask some of the national Zika talk. Brazilians really care about Carnival.”

It seemed everyone, including myself, was more interested in celebrating Carnival, the good, instead of Zika, the bad.

Brazilians have an impressive lust for life -- showcased by their obsession with Carnival and wild street parties -- and in Rio the Cariocas had a fun energy and happiness that seems to them a resilience of some sort, a desire to party on despite their recent negative press and threat of disease.

Though Ellie is not concerned about Zika at the moment, she said that if she was planning on getting pregnant sometime soon, she would take extra precautions by wearing bug spray more frequently and avoiding having any standing water by her house. However, nothing as drastic as contemplating a move out of the country.

Of course, my experience a significant distance from the hotbed of Zika activity in Brazil does not necessarily represent what is happening across the country. And Zika virus, of which so little concrete information is known, will require dedicated research and an international effort to ensure it doesn't get worse.

As for me, I would go back to Brazil -- or any country in South or Central America, for that matter -- in a heartbeat.

The musician has had a long, hard couple weeks. First, he got into a Twitter feud with Wiz Khalifa that ended in an anal joke. Not too long after, West claimed that Bill Cosby, accused by 46 women of sexual assault, was innocent. Then he appeared to ask Mark Zuckerberg for $1 billion.

Despite positive early reviews for The Life of Pablo, his Twitter appears to have grown increasingly disorganized. Just take a look at today's barrage:

Swift's donation comes after a tweetstorm by singer Demi Lovato who, some say, was making a subtle reference to Swift when she posted the below tweets.

Swift made some waves last Monday at The Grammy Awards when, during her acceptance speech for her Album of the Year award, she apparently fired back at frenemy Kanye West over a controversial line on his new album in which he proclaims, about to Swift to have, ""made that bitch famous."" 

Said Swift: 

""As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there: there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. But if you just focus on the work and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you’ll know it was you and the people who love you who put you there and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.""

It's biggest star? Well that depends on who you ask. Daisy Ridley is a first choice for many people. So is John Boyega. However, if we're being honest here, the only choice is BB-8, the round droid that stole our hearts and the show.

See also: Sphero BB-8 vs. Hasbro BB-8, an epic droid battle

We've already been graced with at least two pretty fantastic BB-8 robot toys. Sphero, which helped design the technology inside the on-screen BB-8, probably has the best of them with the palm-sized, app-controlled BB-8 by Sphero. Hasbro's remote-controlled and considerably larger BB-8 is no slouch, either.

Spin Master, though, may top them all with a nearly-life-sized remote-controlled BB-8. 

The new robotic toy, which has not yet been confirmed by Spin Master or Star Wars franchise-owner Disney, showed up this week on Gizmodo and Disney enthusiast Web site.

Spin Master won't confirm the toy's existence, but sources tells us that the robot is 19-inches tall with antennas. That's still 7-inches shorter than the real BB-8, but also stands 7-inches taller than the Hasbro model. The robot toy will get its official unveiling next week at the Toy Fair 2016 in New York City.

Spin Master already has a pretty considerable Star Wars history. Last year, the company's Air Hogs brand produced both an X-Wing drone and a pretty entertaining Millennium Falcon drone.

The robot will work via a hand-held remote control, respond to voice commands like ""follow me"", move its head and have movie sound effects, according to the reports. It should cost around $180 and ship right before the holiday buying season gets underway.

If it's as popular as the Sphero BB-8, you’ll probably need the Force just to get your hands on one.

Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo and Alcatel also have announcements this weekend, and a day or two later Sony and Xiaomi will join them, among other companies.So what's up? Sunday is when the annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) trade show kicks off in Barcelona, which lasts till Thursday, Feb. 25. SEE ALSO: Don't expect the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge to be cheapMWC, which has been held in Barcelona for 10 years now (before 2006, it was in Cannes), has always been a key event for the global mobile industry, but it hasn't always been that interesting to the consumers. On some years, big players such as LG and Samsung -- wary not to get lost in the rapid-fire announcements from other brands -- launched their products a week or a month before or after MWC. This year is different: Nearly everyone is launching at MWC, which (if you're into smartphones) will make for a very busy, fun week. Here are all the phones we expect to see make their debut:Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 EdgeSamsung has invited the press to one of its marquee ""Unpacked"" events on Sunday, and though the company hasn't officially shared many details, the amount of leaks has been off the charts. We unofficially know the price of the new devices, we've seen how they look, and we know most of the specs.The new Galaxy phones will look very similar to last year's Galaxy S6 and S6 EdgeThe rumor mill consensus is that the new Galaxy phones will look very similar to last year's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, with the biggest updates probably being a pressure-sensitive screen, new VR capabilities (see teaser video, above) and the standard processor and camera upgrades. Both phones are expected to have a Quad HD  (2,560 x 1,440) screens, pack Samsung Exynos 8 8890 octa-core processors, include 4GB of RAM as well as 32GB of storage. The Galaxy S7 is likely to have a 5.1-inch screen and a 3,000mAh (milliamp-hour) battery, while the Galaxy S7 Edge is poised to have a 5.5-inch screen and a bigger, 3,600mAh battery. LG G5잠들지 않는 Play LG G5Always ON #LG #LGG5 #G5 #AlwaysON pic.twitter.com/11BKsUlFJb— LG Mobile (@LG_Mobile_) February 10, 2016
LG, usually known for spilling the beans itself prior to its announcements, has left a bit more to the imagination this year. Yes, the company will be launching its new Android flagship, the LG G5, but we don't know its exact specs, or the looks. We do know the phone will have an ""Always On"" display, but we're not sure what that means, exactly. Some rumors indicate the phone will have an unusual, semi-modular design, and an (admittedly crappy) leaked image shows the phone will have two cameras on the back -- quite possible, given the company's recent X screen ""Specialist"" phone which sports two rear shooters as well. Just like Samsung, LG will be showing off its wares on Sunday, Feb. 21.LG has been busy prior to MWC, too: On Tuesday, the company unveiled the LG Stylus 2, a stylus-equipped (duh) 5.7-inch smartphone with an 1.2GHz quad-core processor, a 13-megapixel rear camera, 1.5GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and a 3,000mAh battery. It, too, will be on display at LG's booth in Barcelona.Huawei, ZTE and AlcatelThe Chinese trio of companies will also be showing off important new devices over the weekend, but we don't know many details about them.Alcatel, which is going first (on Saturday) will be showing a flagship device. The company is best known for its affordable phones with solid specs and at least one or two surprising features (last year's Alcatel Idol 3 had dual speakers and dual microphones designed in such a way that you could hold it upside down and still make a call).We'll start our pre- #MWC16 press briefing in #London in a few hours, where we'll share vision for 2016. Stay tuned! https://t.co/conPvirDsy— Huawei Technologies (@Huawei) February 16, 2016
Huawei told us it would have a ""big announcement"" on Sunday, but there's no details save for an invite that features a stylus -- though this could refer to another device, such as a tablet. The company launched its Mate 8 and Mate S relatively recently, so the device that's most likely to get an upgrade is the smaller but still very capable Huawei P8. Chances are slim, but we'll know more come Sunday.Finally, ZTE, which also has a press conference on Sunday (that's four so far if you're counting), has named its invite ""Imagination and beyond,"" which does not tell us much. The company promises ""exciting announcements,"" and a company rep did tell us we can expect new products, but that's all we have right now.One recent product from the company, the ZTE Axon mini, was quite interesting as it was one of the first Androids to incorporate a pressure-sensitive screen. The way ZTE's press materials are phrased, we don't expect anything big like that, but you never know.Sony and HTCIn the last couple of years, Sony has produced solid phones which mostly fell flat on the market. This made the company a lot less bold about its announcement, and this year we're not expecting anything huge from Sony.There's no telling what Sony might announceThe company does have an event early Monday, but there's no telling what it might announce. It's an event at the company booth at the MWC venue, which often indicates a smaller announcement. In recent years, such events from Sony yielded mostly tablets and wearables. Similarly, HTC will probably not be launching a phone this year, but the company does have a big virtual reality-related announcement. The company has been struggling, and the reception of its HTC One M9 (launched during last year's MWC) was lukewarm at best, so the focus on its eagerly expected HTC Vive VR headset might actually be a good thing.So what could HTC say about the Vive that isn't already known (and we do know it's scheduled for an April launch)? One key bit of info is the price. Its biggest competitor, the Oculus Rift, is currently available for pre-order for $600. If HTC can deliver a similar -- why not better, even? -- package for less, that would be something. Lenovo and XiaomiBrace yourselves for rich & powerful sound as this device is set to deliver the #Knockout punch thanks to DolbyAtmos pic.twitter.com/SqY9oaNMpX— Lenovo India (@Lenovo_in) February 15, 2016

It will also feature Dolby Atmos sound, which should ideally deliver a surround experience through stereo speakers.The company will likely also launch several other gadgets, though we're not expecting anything groundbreaking.China's rising star Xiaomi is the somewhat separated from the pack, as it will be launching its new Xiaomi Mi5 on Wednesday, Feb. 24. It's probably a good thing, as Sunday and Monday are sure to bring a heavy case of gadgets overload, and Xiaomi's new phone will likely be an interesting device. Xiaomi #Mi5 media preview in Barcelona on Feb 24—our first time ever hosting an event at MWC.

Unfortunately, Windows Phone market share has dwindled to below 2% in 2015, and we're not seeing many indications it will recover.Fittingly, Microsoft hasn't made any major announcements related to the platform recently, and it's not likely it'll have any in Barcelona. Sure, Microsoft will be there, in the form of a mid-range WP device from a smaller manufacturer here and there. But don't expect anything groundbreaking.Last year, BlackBerry announced a 5-inch touchscreen phone (yup, BlackBerry's the only company nowadays which has to point out that a phone is touchscreen-equipped) and a slider. Both phones went nowhere, and though it's perfectly likely the company will launch more phones this year, their fate will probably be similar.As always, there will be a smorgasbord of midrange, entry-level and just plain odd phones at the MWC, and probably a few focusing on security (remember last year's Blackphone 2?). We won't be making any predictions, but we'll be on the lookout for anything fresh....and not a single smartwatchEven though MWC is a mobile industry event, I've written numerous prediction posts and roundups about it over the years, and this is the first time I focused almost exclusively on mobile phones.There's a reason for that:  I've seen very few invitations for anything other than phones this year. While this is just one event (albeit a very big one), this could be an indication of a trend dying out: smartwatches. In the last three years, the MWC venue was chock full of smartwatches, smartbands and other smart, wearable thingies. This year, however, it's just phones and a few virtual reality gadgets.There are many possible reasons for the lack of smartwatch buzz prior to the event. Perhaps the timing's off -- Samsung launched its Gear S2 smartwatch relatively recently, in October. Or maybe the smartwatches are there, but the manufacturers have been keeping them tightly under wraps as a surprise. But it could also be an indication of dwindling interest. Could the world already be sick of smartwatches? We'll have a better idea in a week. Have something to add to this story?

"56c4574012d2cd28b90004f1","Rachel Thompson","Lifestyle","LONDON -- Millions of Brits are putting their health at risk by unwittingly consuming alarming levels of sugar in flavoured hot beverages from high street coffee chains, a campaign group has warned.  

See also: Starbucks grape chai orange cinnamon concoction is enraging Britain

Campaign group Action on Sugar (AoS) warned of the dangerously high sugar content of popular flavoured drinks -- including matcha and chai lattes, hot chocolate, and variations on coffee -- with some containing up to 25 teaspoons of sugar; the equivalent to three cans of Coca Cola.

According to AoS, 98% of the hot flavoured drinks surveyed would receive a red label for excessive levels of sugars per serving, with 35% containing the same amount or more sugar than a can of Coca Cola. 

AoS surveyed 131 hot drinks from UK coffee chains and fast food outlets, including Caffe Nero, Starbucks, Costa, Greggs, EAT, Pret a Manger, McDonalds and KFC. 

Researchers found the Starbucks' large hot mulled fruit -- a mix of chai, fruit concentrate, topped with a cinnamon stick and a slice of orange -- to be the worst offender, containing 25 teaspoons of sugar, the same amount of sugar found in five muffins, and more than three times the maximum daily intake of sugar for adults. Product information was collected online, in store and direct from manufacturers. 

Costa Coffee's large chai latte was also found to contain 20 teaspoons of sugar, while Starbucks' large white chocolate mocha with whipped cream contains 18 teaspoons of sugar.

One in five people visit a coffee shop every day in the UK, and an estimated 1.7 billion cups of coffee are sold each year in the UK from over 18,000 retailers. 

The news comes just before the release of the government's Childhood Obesity Strategy, where David Cameron is expected to deliver a robust, evidence-based plan for the UK to prevent childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes. AoS is calling for a ban on the marketing of unhealthy products and a 20% tax of sugar-sweetened drinks. 

“This is yet again another example of scandalous amount of sugar added to our food and drink. No wonder we have the highest rates of obesity in Europe,"" Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Queen Mary University of London and Chair of AoS, said in a statement. 

“David Cameron now has all the evidence to make the UK the first country in the world to stop the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemic,” he continued.

 “Earlier this year we committed to reduce added sugar in our indulgent drinks by 25% by the end of 2020,"" a Starbucks spokesperson told AoS.

HTC announced at Mobile World Congress the Vive will cost $799 in the U.S., a $200 premium over the Oculus Rift. It'll cost £689 in the UK.

See also: HTC Vive Pre is a killer VR experience

Pre-orders for the VR headset will still open on Feb. 29, with devices shipping out in early April.

Before you freak out over how expensive the Vive is (and how much VR will cost for first adopters), it's helpful to understand why.

While the Vive and Rift headsets are going to offer very similar visual experiences, the Vive ships with something the Rift doesn't: proper VR controllers. The Rift comes with a wireless Xbox One controller and not the Oculus Touch hand controllers, which won't be available until later this year.

The controllers make all the difference. Without them, controlling things in VR isn't nearly as intuitive and natural. It's like drawing with a stylus versus using a computer mouse. VR is simply more immersive with hand controllers.

What's inside the box

Here's everything you get when you throw down $800 for the Vive:

Vive headset
Vive controllers (one for each hand)
Vive base stations (2)
Vive link box
Vive ear buds
2 included games

You'll get the VR headset, of course. The final version will look very similar to the Pre model we saw at CES

The two base station boxes that track your body movement and create a virtual room with a 16-foot diagonal will be wireless (they need to be plugged into a power source, but not your computer) and quieter, HTC says. Though there will be an optimal setup (usually positioned above you and in a corner), you'll be able to position them from various angles, like on a bookshelf or on a coffee table. Heck, you can tape them to a wall, if you want, we're told.

The link box is a small black box used to connect the Vive headset to a computer.

As important as the visual experience is for a VR headset, audio is equally important. As such, the Vive include a pair of earbuds.

The Vive will come bundled with two games: Job Simulator: The 2050 Archives and Fantastic Contraption. Additional games and content will be available through Valve's Steam.

Here's Job Simulator: The 2050 Archives...

...and here's Fantastic Contraption in action:

Like the Oculus Rift, you'll need to have a powerful enough PC to run the Vive. HTC didn't provide specific minimum specs that users will need, nor did it say if the Vive will be sold with PC bundles like the Rift.

We were only told you should have a PC with an NVIDIA GeForce G70 or AMD Radeon RD 290x or newer graphics card. Needless to say, your puny Ultrabook won't cut it.

With pricing set for both the Rift and Vive, the ball is now in Sony's court. How much will the PlayStation VR cost? Pricing it cheaper than its primary competitors could help it win over consumers.

"56bc9419b589e441910007e8","Gillian Edevane","Entertainment","Gather 'round the campfire, kids. It's time for me to regale you with details of my dart session with Ryan Williams and TJ Miller. 

The two Deadpool stars were in San Francisco last week to promote their new film, and I was lucky enough to score five minutes with them.  Alas, if you’re hoping for a celebrity horror story, I’m afraid this isn’t one. Both were talkative and totally willing to pretend I won our game for the sake of this article. (I did not win, for the record. I barely hit the picture of Wolverine that I’m pretty sure Reynolds taped up.)

In Deadpool, which hits theaters Friday, Reynolds plays Wade Wilson, an antihero who upends traditional Marvel tropes with his NSFW sense of humor. To give you an idea, ""dickthissle"" and ""wheezing bag of dick tits"" are just a few of the actor's favorite lines from the movie -- many of which stem from the comic book's own use of profanity. 

Between throwing darts, Reynolds revealed that his alter-ego's notorious comical flair has a deeper meaning; it serves as the character's primary defense mechanism, a method of coping that hits home for the actor.

""That's his triumph over injustice,"" Reynolds said of his character. ""For me, I've always kind of filtered any kind of pain I'm in through the prism of humor in some way. I think Wade Wilson's the same way...I'm the youngest of three very large boys. My brothers are big boys, and you had to have a sense of humor in our household in order to survive."" 

Miller, who plays Wilson's friend Weasel, also knows a thing or two about using humor to confront life's complexities. 

""I think that seeing the world through the jester's eyes is the only way to see it clearly,"" the actor said, prompting Reynolds to playfully call the line ""poetry.""  

The notorious dirty jokes in Deadpool earned it a special place in history as one of the rare R-rated comic book adaptations to hit the big screen -- a classification Reynolds pushed for as a producer, Miller said.  

Many fans have interpreted the mature rating as sign that the the film will honor its source material rather than toning things down in an attempt to win a wider audience. That puts the movie in sharp contrast to 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which featured a widely-derided depiction of Deadpool. Reynolds, who also played that version of the character, has long been waiting for a redo. 

""I've been attached to this film for 11 years, and I've wanted to make it the right way,"" he said. ""I just thought for the character, to really do it justice, you really have to unleash him and just let him have no ceiling at all and no filter at all."" 

If that was the production's primary goal, the film already seems to have hit a bullseye. Check out the uncensored trailer over at the movie's official website.

In a new video posted over the weekend, the controversial YouTube comedian bashes Sports Illustrated for putting a plus size model (Ashley Graham) on the cover of its annual swimsuit issue. 

""Barbie had to look like she eats cheeseburgers to make feminists happy,"" she says in the beginning of the video, referring to the 28-year-old Graham, an advocate for body-positive messages.

Graham, one of three cover models for the 2016 special issue, is the first plus-size model to grace the cover of the magazine.

“If any of the other models showed up looking like her, they’d be fired,"" Arbour argues. ""How the f*ck is that fair? The truth is if she worked out a little bit more, she wouldn’t be plus size any more, which means she can’t sell shit to plus size women who’ve turned her into their hero. So to make money, she’s keeping the weight on.”

The video blogger's  ""second helping"" video comes months after her original rant, in which she argues fat shaming is a positive way to encourage weight loss. It went viral in September after tons of people in the YouTube community and all across social media called Arbour out.

"56cb8828b05f9d274f000176","Andrew Freedman","World","Meet the sea butterfly. Unlike most species of zooplankton that occupy the all-important base of the marine food web, this sea snail earned its nickname by behaving more like an insect, fluttering its wings from top to bottom and contorting its tiny body to propel itself upward through the water column.Nearly all other species of zooplankton use their limbs like paddles to move through the water, according to a new study in the Journal of Experimental Biology. SEE ALSO: Sea level is now rising at its fastest rate in nearly 3,000 yearsIn the study, researchers from Georgia Tech collected hundreds of the tiny mollusks from the Pacific Ocean and used high-speed cameras to record their movement, seeking to figure out precisely how and why the sea butterfly behaves like such an insect-plankton hybrid, or in the scientists' words, ""a remarkable example of convergent evolution.""What they found, using high-speed photography, was that the sea butterfly moves through the water similarly to how tiny insects like thrips and fruit flies fly through the air: by flapping its wings in a figure-eight pattern.""Our measurements strongly indicate that L. helicina uniquely employs lift-based swimming instead of drag-based swimming used by nearly all zooplankton,"" the study states.           The scientists discovered that the sea butterfly stands alone in contorting its body in ways that complement its strokes through the water to accentuate lift.""Snails evolutionarily diverged from flying insects 550 million years ago,” said Donald Webster, a Georgia Tech engineering professor, in a press release. “Hence, it is amazing that marine snails are using the same figure-eight wing pattern that is typical of their very distant airborne relatives.” Both the sea butterfly and particular insect species use a Weis-Fogh clap-and-fling mechanism (named after the Danish zoologist who first described it), during which it claps its wings together and then rapidly flings them apart to generate enhanced lift.However, the sea butterfly sets itself apart by rotating its body 60 degrees as it performs its power stroke, making sure the weight of its shell doesn't cause it to sink to the bottom of the ocean.“Insects and birds don’t typically rotate their bodies in a similar manner to generate lift,” Webster said. “By rotating their shell during each stroke, sea butterflies put their wings in a position to always generate upward thrust and fly forward.""One of the motivations for this study is to determine how sea butterflies and other pteropods may respond to increasingly acidic ocean waters. Oceans are absorbing more carbon dioxide because of the burning of fossil fuels for energy. When dissolved into seawater, carbon dioxide eventually forms carbonic acid, which has many impacts, including impeding some species' ability to create and maintain their calcium carbonate-based shells.According to Georgia Tech, scientists hope to conduct research on how ocean acidification-related changes in shell composition and fluid viscosity will affect the sea butterfly's ability to rotate and fly upward.The team is also interested in using the biomechanics of this creature to help engineers create tiny autonomous robots that swim in the ocean, gathering data as they do so. ",0.214421850079745,0.565090377458799,"http://mashable.com/2016/02/22/sea-snail-ocean-video/",516,12,90,2,7,1,0,"2016-02-22T22:12:58+00:00",456,1,"Watch this sea snail flutter through the ocean just like a butterfly",0,0,"Climate, ocean acidification, oceans, strange creatures, World","rising"
"56c761b097b2f86ca00000b3","The Conversation","World","Demand for innovation is at an all-time high. Innovation is now recognized as being key to economic growth strategies in the United States, Canada and countries in the European Union.

As a result, there is an increased need to understand what drives innovation. Certainly traditional research and development, funded by both the private and public sectors, continues to remain a primary source of new ideas and products. But innovation demands innovators.

So where do innovators come from? And how do they acquire their skills?

One place — perhaps among the best — is college. Over the past seven years, my research has explored the influence of college on preparing students with the capacity, desire and intention to innovate.

In this time we’ve learned that many academic and social experiences matter quite a bit; grades, however, do not matter as much.

What influences student innovation?

Our ongoing research, an example of which can be found here, has surveyed over 10,000 full-time undergraduate and graduate students in four countries — the United States, Canada, Germany and Qatar.

Our sample includes a wide diversity of students: those in fields of study often associated with innovation and entrepreneurship (e.g., business, engineering) as well as more traditional majors (e.g., arts, humanities, education); those from differing races/ethnicities and gender identifications; those from different socioeconomic and political backgrounds; and those from families that already include, or do not include, entrepreneurs.

To learn more, we asked students about their innovation intentions and capacities, their higher education experiences, and their background characteristics. We also administered a “personality inventory” to address the question of whether innovators are born or made.

We conducted a series of statistical analyses that allowed us to isolate the influence of any one individual attribute (e.g., classroom experiences, GPA, personality, gender, etc.) on our innovation outcomes.

Here is what our analyses have revealed so far:

	Classroom practices make a difference: students who indicated that their college assessments encouraged problem-solving and argument development were more likely to want to innovate. Such an assessment frequently involves evaluating students in their abilities to create and answer their own questions; to develop case studies based on readings as opposed to responding to hypothetical cases; and/or to make and defend arguments. Creating a classroom conducive to innovation was particularly important for undergraduate students when compared to graduate students.

	Faculty matters — a lot: students who formed a close relationship with a faculty member or had meaningful interactions (i.e., experiences that had a positive influence on one’s personal growth, attitudes and values) with faculty outside of class demonstrated a higher likelihood to be innovative. When a faculty member is able to serve as a mentor and sounding board for student ideas, exciting innovations may follow.

Interestingly, we saw the influence of faculty on innovation outcomes in our analyses even after accounting for a student’s field of study, suggesting that promoting innovation can happen across disciplines and curricula. Additionally, when we ran our statistical models using a sample of students from outside the United States, we found that faculty relationships were still very important. So, getting to know a faculty member might be a key factor for promoting innovation among college students, regardless of where the education takes place or how it is delivered.

	Peer networking is effective: outside the classroom, students who connected course learning with social issues and career plans were also more innovative. For example, students who initiated informal discussions about how to combine the ideas they were learning in their classes to solve common problems and address global concerns were the ones who most likely recognized opportunities for creating new businesses or nonprofit social ventures.

Being innovative was consistently associated with the college providing students with space and opportunities for networking, even after considering personality type, such as being extroverted.

Networking remained salient when we analyzed a sample of graduate students — in this instance, those pursuing M.B.A. degrees in the United States. We take these findings as a positive indication that students are spending their “out-of-class” time learning to recognize opportunities and discussing new ideas with peers.

Who are the innovators?

On the basis of our findings, we believe that colleges might be uniquely positioned to cultivate a new generation of diverse innovators.

Counter to the Thiel Fellowship, an initiative that pays individuals to step out of college in order to become entrepreneurs, our work supports efforts by colleges and universities to combine classroom learning with entrepreneurial opportunities and to integrate education with innovation.

One of our most interesting findings was that as GPAs went down, innovation tended to go up. Even after considering a student’s major, personality traits and features of the learning environment, students with lower GPAs reported innovation intentions that were, on average, greater than their higher-GPA counterparts.

In short: GPA was associated with innovation, but maybe not in the direction you’d think.

Why might this be the case?

From our findings, we speculate that this relationship may have to do with what innovators prioritize in their college environment: taking on new challenges, developing strategies in response to new opportunities and brainstorming new ideas with classmates.

Time spent in these areas might really benefit innovation, but not necessarily GPA.

Additionally, findings elsewhere strongly suggest that innovators tend to be intrinsically motivated — that is, they are interested in engaging pursuits that are personally meaningful, but might not be immediately rewarded by others.

We see this work as confirmation of our findings — grades, by their very nature, tend to reflect the abilities of individuals motivated by receiving external validation for the quality of their efforts.

Perhaps, for these reasons, the head of people operations at Google has noted:

GPAs are worthless as a criteria for hiring.

Somewhat troubling, though in line with concerns that plague the entrepreneurship community, women were less likely to demonstrate innovation intentions than men, all else being equal.

This is a problem, especially given jarring statistics that venture capitalists are funding males — specifically white males — more than any other group.

Such findings also speak to the need for higher education to intervene and actively introduce the broadest range of individuals to educational experiences and environments that spur the generation and implementation of new ideas. Fresh and creative ideas, after all, are not restricted to any one gender, race or family background.

Hazelbrook Public School in the Blue Mountains near Sydney is the first school to purchase its uniforms from Change Threads, a local company that focusses on the ethical sourcing of garments. The uniforms are made with cotton, and polyester from plastic bottles.

""All of our garments are made in India from Organic and Fairtrade certified cotton. Our woven fabrics are blended with polyester made from recycled plastic bottles, providing an ethical supply chain and garments of exceptional quality,"" the Change Threads website explained. 

It's also the first school in Australia that has its main uniform item, a polo shirt, certified by Fairtrade Australia, a Fairtrade spokesperson confirmed to Mashable Australia. 

""We are very excited by the positive buzz it has created,"" the spokesperson said. ""There are certainly some schools that had been purchasing fair trade uniforms. To our knowledge Hazelbrook is the first school, with its main uniform item, to have Fairtrade certification. It is an exciting step.""

Molly Harriss Olson, CEO Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand, also praised the move in an emailed statement to Mashable Australia. 

“We’re delighted with Hazelbrook Primary School's move to uniforms made with Fairtrade cotton. It's a great milestone and their uniform supplier, Change Threads, has done a great job in helping to make this possible,"" she said.

“Cotton farmers are often the invisible part of the supply chain. Fairtrade helps ensure they receive a fair and stable price for their produce as well as an additional amount which can be used to invest in community projects such as building schools, health centres and improving water supplies.""

Change Threads partnered with Indian cotton farmers and clothes producers to create the polo shirts for students that are in accordance with international Fair Trade standards. This means workers are paid a fair wage, long-term contracts are put in place, there is no forced or child labour and the materials are environmentally friendly.

 

Parents can purchase the school's polo shirts online, in a local store or at the school's uniform shop.

Change Threads founder and mother of four children, Anna Dohnt, visited India to investigate the clothing supply chain and became shocked at what she found. 

""What I discovered as I 'followed the thread' of the cotton supply chain is that exploitation occurs at almost every stage of clothing production,"" Dohnt said in a statement. ""Alarmingly, the clothing industry often involves forced labour, including child labour. To me, it is not okay that our children are wearing cotton everyday that is often produced by slaves. It’s not okay that my family is part of someone else's suffering.""

So Dohnt launched Change Threads, to create ethical clothing for local children and to help children in developing countries.

""If you stop and think about it, it's outrageous that children in India are unable to go to school because they’re making school uniforms for kids in Australia wear to school,"" Dohnt said. ""I don't think any parent would argue that this inequality is okay, so I think it makes sense for schools to be offering fair trade uniform options.""

The idea has paid off, with interest rolling in from around the country. Dohnt has had to reorganise the structure of her company to cope. Not that it matters, as schools start to look to come on board to help make the world a more sustainable place, one polo shirt at a time.

The police said Hamid Reza Jafary and his gang of five Pakistani suspects were arrested on Monday. Jafary is wanted in several countries, including Thailand, Britain, France, New Zealand and Australia, the Bangkok Post reported.

The group is suspected of selling forged passports mostly to customers from Iran, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, to be used to enter countries in Europe and Australia, and is the largest such ring to be busted in the last few years, immigration bureau chief Nathathorn Prousoontorn told reporters.

Police discovered equipment at Jafary's home such as stamping machines, and other devices used for sewing and engraving paper. They also found 173 finished passports.

Jafary reportedly confessed to his crimes, and said he charged about 50,000 - 80,000 baht ($1,415 - $2,264) per passport. Customers ordered the documents via the Internet, and transferred money to the ring's bank accounts, before the bogus passports were sent by courier over to them.

Thailand has been a hotbed for passport forgers, and the country has busted several rings in recent years. In March 2015, authorities busted what they called one of the largest networks in the country that had been operating for more than a decade, the Associated Press reported.

The ring was led by an Iranian man named Murel Gurat, and he was apprehended with a haul of 1,053 stolen passports from some 60 nationalities, mostly European.

Just a month later, a Pakistani forger suspected of leading an international passport forgery network was arrested in Bangkok. Police raided Abdul Ganni's home, after authorities suspected he was supplying fake passports to the mafia and Al-Qaeda's terrorist network, said the Bangkok Post.

"56bcd5cb97b2f866df000a75","Brian Ries","World","A California congressman took a big ol' rip of a vaporizer on Thursday morning to make his point that vaping is safe -- and thus should be allowed on planes.

Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican from San Diego County, took the puff during a meeting of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which was weighing an amendment to ban vaping from the nation's friendly skies.

""This is called a vaporizer,"" said Hunter after blowing out a big, white plume, eliciting laughter in the room. ""There's no combustion, there's no carcinogens,"" he said, adding that the device helped him quit smoking and, in the future, we will all vape to consume drugs like ibuprofen.

Watch @Rep_Hunter take a rip of a vaporizer at a House hearing that considered banning vaping on planes. pic.twitter.com/jxTtoJhwL9— Mashable News (@MashableNews) February 11, 2016

The amendment, however, was adopted by a vote of 33-26. ""Despite the best efforts of Representative Hunter, who came equipped with his vaping device and demonstrated its use, members were not impressed enough to defeat my amendment,"" said Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who had introduced it.

The congressman's vaping stance appears to be at odds with findings by the federal government; multiple studies have found toxic chemicals in the vapor.

""Analysis of the electronic cigarette samples showed that the product contained detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals to which users could potentially be exposed,"" the FDA stated on its website after a study conducted in 2014. ""Testing also suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent.""

That's not to mention that some vaporizers are powered by lithium batteries and, like cheap hoverboards, could cause a fire. Most airlines already ban their use in flight, and you can't pack them in checked baggage.

Hunter, who wrote an editorial for The Hill in December boldly proclaiming that yes, he vaped, even though ""vaping isn’t as sexy as smoking old-fashioned cigarettes,"" either doesn't agree, or doesn't care.

""The reason I vape is simple: It’s so I don’t smoke cigarettes. I vape knowing that I’m not inhaling tobacco. Most importantly, I vape because I believe it could save my life,"" he wrote.

"56cb1c1c97b2f80bba000298","Stan Schroeder","Tech","BARCELONA -- Remember the FLIR One thermal camera that attached to your phone, giving it thermal vision capabilities? A new rugged phone from Cat has a similar camera built in. The company showed off a prototype of the device a day ahead of Mobile World Congress on Sunday, and though it appeared to have some serious battery issues, it was one of the most interesting phones we've seen in Barcelona so far. SEE ALSO: First look: Samsung Gear 360 consumer VR cameraIt's called the Cat S60 and has two cameras that work together: a regular one provides an outline of objects as seen in visible light, and a thermal camera shows thermal footprints, normally invisible to the naked eye. The two cameras work together. The company rep showcased the thermal camera mode at Mobile World Congress by covering the regular camera with his finger; you could still see the thermal vision on the phone's screen. Thermal cameras allow you to see infrared light, electromagnetic radiation that you normally cannot.          The thermal camera can measure surface temperatures from a distance of up to 100 feet. According to the company, it can primarily be used during construction for detecting gas or water leaks, but some other use cases -- firefighting, rescue missions and police work -- come to mind, too. It would be able to see warm pipes behind thin walls, for example.          The Cat S60 features some other tricks. It can survive submerged in water up to 16.4 feet of depth for one hour and has a huge 3,800mAh battery. Other specs include a 4.7-inch HD screen (it supports wet finger and gloved operation), a Snapdragon 617 octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. While the phone seems best suited for professionals rather than regular users, the $599 price point isn't too bad; those with a bit of disposable income could pick it up for the fun of checking out objects' thermal footprints (yes, you can do the trick where you place your hand on a surface and remove it, and the phone will still see the heat signature). One bug that will hopefully be ironed out: The phone was constantly at a very low battery percentage, despite being plugged into an outlet. We suspect the thermal imaging drains the battery life, but Cat says this should be optimized before the phone hits the market, which should be sometime this summer.Have something to add to this story?

These seven lesser known museums around the U.S. will entertain, educate and, in one case, possibly confuse you. 

1. Holographic Studios
In an unassuming former blacksmith's forge located on the east side of midtown Manhattan, the world's largest collection of motion-image holograms awaits. 

Holographic Studios was founded by one of the original holography pioneers, Jason Sapan, in 1979. It is home to over 200 holograms, including one of Andy Warhol paging through a tabloid in 1976 -- an image for which Warhol himself posed. 

Kitsch as it may seem, Sapan, also known as Dr. Laser, is an illustrious figure in the entertainment industry. He was responsible for the laser light effects for the original Studio 54 on CBS and served as a consultant for the film Vanilla Sky. 

2. UFO Museum and Research Center
There is no shortage of documentation or debate around the Roswell incident -- the crash of an alleged flying saucer -- and the UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, is the unofficial home of it all. 

Founded in 1991, the museum showcases history from the Roswell incident alongside other 'evidence' of the existence of UFOs, crop circles, alien abductions and more. 

Worth a visit, whether you believe the museum's motto that, ""the truth is here"" or not. 

 3. Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Museum
Downtown Alexandria, Virginia, is home to a tiny space with a big name: The Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Museum. 

Inside the doors of this sweet yellow building lies a truly incredible collection of herbal botanicals, handblown glass and medical equipment, much of which has been a part of the space since it was a fully operational, family-owned pharmacy right through the 1800s up until the Great Depression.

Meticulously preserved and restored, it truly transports visitors to another era and the local visitors on hand share horrifying and fascinating tales of colonial-era medicinal procedures.

This one has recently reopened after a renovation that saw the first-floor retail space repainted based on a paint analysis that aimed to restore the room to its original appearance. 

4. Mütter Museum
The  Mütter Museum's official website asks potential visitors, ""Are you ready to be disturbingly informed?"" And, to that, we answer a hearty yes.
 
Once you've seen the apothecary of the past in Virginia, skip over to Philadelphia, where the Mütter Museum houses a collection of medical artifacts, including a sections of Albert Einstein's brain (we kid you not) and a collection of 139 human skulls from Viennese anatomist Joseph Hyrtl. 

If you're feeling queasy already, don't fret: You can find some relief at The Benjamin Rush Medicinal Plant Garden, a pleasant courtyard boasting over 60 different types of herbs that have historical and occasionally contemporary medicinal value. 

5. Museum of Jurassic Technology
'Jurassic Technology' may seem like an oxymoron, but this much-loved museum in Los Angeles' Culver City proves otherwise. 

Founded by David Wilson, a man who once designed animations and miniature models for commercials and firms, the maze-like space is difficult to explain or define and, as many a Yelp reviewer will attest, is more likely to leave you feeling confused than educated -- and we mean that in the best way possible. 

Amongst the peculiarities, you'll find a scale model of Noah's Ark, a horn supposedly grown from a woman's head and a collection of micromosaics by Henry Dalton. 

Our advice: Enter this one with an open mind. 

6. Historic Auto Attraction
Seventy-five historic autos are displayed in this incredible Roscoe, Illinois museum that has won the hearts of auto enthusiasts and entertainment buffs alike.

Not only is this kitsch space home to John Dillinger's getaway car, Elvis Presley's personal car and the Batmobile, it is also home to a NASA exhibit with a quarter scale lunar module and space shuttle tire and a White House exhibition that showcases artifacts and furniture that once graced the rooms of the White House.

This eclectic mix is owned by businessman Wayne Lensing, an ex-auto assembly line worker who got rich with his business Lefthander Chassis, a company that builds and manufactures chassis for short-track racing. 

One of the things that makes it so unmissable is its offbeat curatorial decisions: Beyond the autos, the space houses a collection of artifacts from history and entertainment that feel as though they have been chosen at random. 

 7. Burlingame Museum of Pez Memorabilia 
Here's something you never knew you needed: A visit to the Pez museum.

The sweet spot in Burlingame, California, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, offers a snapshot of pop-culture history through the very specific lens of Pez. It is home to over 900 characters, some of which date back to 1950, as well as the World's Largest Pez Dispenser -- a snowman measuring 7 feet, 20 inches tall. 

People may come for the Pez, but they stay for the toys. The space is shared with the Classic Toy Museum and a Banned Toy Museum, the latter of which houses toys that were pulled off the shelves because they were dangerous, completely politically incorrect or, in some rare cases, a combination of both.

See also: Aston Martin teams with Faraday Future to make Tesla competitor

Created by the virtually unknown and truly unfortunately named British carmaker Arash (there's a dermatology joke in there somewhere), the AF10 looks like an amalgam of the Ferrari Enzo and a Pagani Huayra. If you look past its derivative body lines, however, you'll find a very technically impressive -- and super-fast -- car.

Peel away the carbon-reinforced plastic (CRFP) bodywork and you'll find a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine that appears to be borrowed from the Corvette Z06, four electric motors and five gearboxes that together combine in what Arash calls its ""warp drive system."" Altogether the car puts out 2,080 horsepower, good for a 0-60mph time of 2.8 seconds on the way to its 201mph top speed. In its press release, Arash brags that acceleration time is ""really, really, really, REALLY fast.""

The car has a whole lot of power generators mounted inside a carbon-fiber chassis along with a 32 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that feeds all four electric motors.

The car, like any good high-performance hybrid, can be operated in all-electric mode or full hybrid. Relying solely on the 32kWh battery pack, without the help of the V8, the AF10's 0-60 mph time is nearly doubled to around 4.6 seconds. I mean, why even bother?

The tech parade doesn't end at the powertrain. The doors, for example, are operated by gesture control. And the dash has been fitted with a touchless infotainment system called AirBar from Neonode, which debuted at CES this year.

If you're an interested buyer and want to see the Arash AF10 in the flesh, you'll have to make your way to the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland that kicks off early next month where it will make its official debut. In the meantime, you can debate whether you really want to tell people you have an ""Arash"" and the suffer the dermatologically confused and mildly grossed-out looks you'll get in response.

"56c3e929b05f9d253d0001ba","Karissa Bell","Tech","Scientists at the University of Southampton are offering a tantalizing look into a new type of technology that could be be the future of data storage.

The new technology, dubbed ""Superman memory crystal,"" uses lasers and nanostructures to record huge amounts of data onto tiny glass disks. The research, which is being presented at a conference in San Francisco this week, could allow people to preserve data and documents for billions of years, scientists say.

See also: Data transmission rates are hitting ludicrous speeds in the lab

The researchers have been experimenting with the technology, called 5-dimensional data storage, since 2013 when they first used the technique to record 300KB of text. Now, the technology has progressed enough that scientists are able to store up to 360TB of data on the disks. The ""5D"" technology uses a combination of lasers and tiny nanostructures to record the data, which can be viewed with an optical microscope and a polarizer. 
 
Perhaps the most intriguing part of the technology is that its creators promise the disks will have a ""virtually unlimited"" lifetime, if stored at room temperature (they estimate the disks will survive up to 13.8 billion years at 190 degrees Celsius.) 

Though promising, the technology, which is being presented at the Optical Engineering Conference in San Francisco this week, is still at a relatively early stage as it requires expensive lasers to do the actual recording. But the researchers say they are looking for partners that could help commercialize the technique so it could be available outside of a lab.

They note 5D data storage could have a huge impact on how some of history's most important documents -- like the Magna Carta and Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) -- are preserved and have already recorded copies of the UDHR, the Magna Carta, the King James Bible and Newton's Opticks.

Soon, you'll be able to hum the tune into your Xiaomi phone -- and hopefully, it will be able to identify your earworm.

The Chinese phone giant began beta testing the feature among several thousand users. Depending on how the trial period goes, the company to add the functionality to all of its handsets in March, according to ACRCloud, a Beijing-based company powering the music recognition behind Xiaomi products. (You have to run Xiaomi's MIUI interface for this, of course. It won't be available if you've flashed your device.)

Peach also uses ACRCloud for its song recognition feature.

Xiaomi's move is similar to Apple's decision to integrate Shazam in iOS 8, allowing users to ask Siri what song they're listening to.

Shazam can't identify the song you're humming, though; it needs to hear actual song playing. But one of its closest competitors, SoundHound, can.

Tony Li, a representative with ACRCloud, told Mashable the company hopes it can beat SoundHound with its technology that allows ACRCloud to extract the melodies of songs from tracks automatically.

SoundHound, in comparison, relies on users contributing their humming samples to its database to recognize music, Li said. 

""To add one song into [SoundHound's] database, it must look for at least one user to sing or hum the melody without instrumental accompaniment,"" Li said. ACRCloud can extract the vocalist's melody track and isolate it from the background accompaniment.

ACRCloud discards songs that don't match the humming sample before quickly scanning a smaller pool. When we tested it, the service identified most of the songs we sang within 20 seconds.

SoundHound and ACRCloud aren't alone in the ability to identify a song by humming, however. Another service called Tunebot can do the same, but requests that users submit humming samples to teach its engine.

Brittin was answering questions Thursday from the Public Accounts Committee over the £130 million ($188 million) that Google agreed to pay the UK in back taxes over 10 years, a deal that was lauded by Chancellor George Osborne but has angered many people.

Google, along with other multinational companies like Facebook, Amazon and Starbucks, has been under fire in the UK over the amount of tax it pays. 

""I understand the anger,"" Brittin said. 

Labour MP and committee chair Meg Hillier questioned whether he really did understand the anger of ordinary voters, and asked what he got paid.

""If that's relevant I'll happily disclose that to the committee,"" he said. She pressed the issue, asking him a few times what he got paid but not getting an answer.

""You don't know what you get paid? Perhaps you can give us a ballpark of what you get paid?"" Hillier asked.

""It's a salary but I'll provide a figure privately,"" Brittin said, perhaps giving support to Hillier's assertion that Brittin is out of touch with ordinary people.

Google has kept its headquarters in Ireland for years where tax rates are lower than in the UK -- its second-largest market outside the U.S. 

“I understand the anger and understand that people when they see reported that we are paying 3% tax would be angry. But we’re not. We’re paying 20% tax,” he said.

Tom Hutchinson, vice president of Google Inc., defended the tax deal but didn't know why Google hadn't paid its tax in 10 years. “That is a good question,” he said.

In an article in the Telegraph, Brittin wrote that international tax rules need to be rewritten to make things simpler, but that change needed to come from governments.

"56cc0e58b05f9d274f000433","Ariel Bogle","Business","The U.S. has Lyft and India has Ola, but since Uber landed in Australia in 2012, the country has mostly been a one ride-share company town.

A local startup plans to change that. On Monday, GoCatch, an app that connects users directly with taxis, launched its new ride-share offering, GoCar. After downloading the app, users in Sydney will be able to choose between a taxi or a GoCar -- a driver using his or her own car to pick up passengers, in the same vein as UberX. 

But is GoCatch ready to take on Uber, which has a head start in the market and healthy name recognition?

See also: Qantas to launch super-speed inflight Wi-Fi so you never need to log off

Ned Moorfield, GoCatch CEO, thinks his company is up to the challenge. Go Catch, which has been operating for five years, already has 350,000 passengers registered nationally, Moorfield told Mashable Australia. Users in Sydney, the only city where GoCar is initially launching, will immediately see the ride-share option in the app, giving the company easy access to a potential user base.

""We're really hitting the ground running, because we've already got a lot of people actively using the app booking taxis,"" he said.

Finding a niche

One way GoCatch aims to differentiate itself from Uber is by avoiding that company's much maligned surge pricing model.

""We don't have surge pricing, which is one of the things we know people really dislike about the Uber app,"" Moorfield said. ""We're going with peak and off-peak rates, so people have a lot more certainty about what they're going to pay."" 

According to the GoCatch website, peak hours include Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. until 10 a.m., Monday to Thursday, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., and Friday to Sunday, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Moorfield added that GoCar should be 20-30% cheaper than a taxi at off-peak times and 10-15% cheaper at peak.

A study by consumer advocacy group Choice in 2015 suggested taxis were 40% more expensive, on average, than UberX.

Moorfield expects customers to be using both apps to get the cheapest fare, turning to GoCar during surges. ""I suspect people will bounce between the two, depending on which is cheaper. Whenever Uber's surging, we're going to be cheaper,"" he said.

How many players can survive?

GoCar is facing one big issue: Does Australia have the population to support multiple ride-share operations?

Geoffrey Clifton, a lecturer in transport management at the University of Sydney, told Mashable Australia it's not yet clear just how many ride-share competitors the Australian market could handle. 

""On the one hand, we want as much competition as possible,"" he said. ""On the other hand, there are network benefits from having bigger players. You can have more cars available at any one point in time.""

Luckily for GoCar, Clifton pointed out there's no real cost to riders when switching between the services if it suits them. ""I can't see it being too much of a challenge for people to switch,"" he said. ""I'd say there's room for a couple of large operators in the market.""

For his part, Moorfield thinks two will work but three is too many. Moorfield pointed to the experience of one of the original U.S. ride share offerings, Sidecar, which shut down in December amid fears ride-sharing can only be a two man show in the U.S between Uber and Lyft.

While drivers would be comfortable accommodating two apps, three is getting unwieldy, Moorfield speculated. ""Stretching it to a third, where the third is going to be struggling to deliver much in the way of [customer] volume, [they're] going to be too far behind,"" he said.

While a Lyft spokesperson told Mashable Australia she could not currently share any Australian expansion plans, it's not clear how GoCar would stand up to the large ride-share company's experience and funding, despite its Australian user base.

""We're proud to have led the way in bringing ridesharing to Australia,"" David Rohrsheim, Uber general manager in Australia, told Mashable Australia in an emailed statement. ""Consumers are now enjoying more choices than ever in how they get around their city.""

Attracting drivers

With Uber already in the market for more than three years, it remains to be seen whether GoCar can attract the drivers necessary to serve all the consumers in need of transport on-demand.

Clifton suggested Uber will have the benefit of name recognition, at least for the moment. ""The first mover advantage means they've got the bulk of people who are interested in driving a car,"" he said. ""At the moment, if you want the depth of the market, you go with Uber.""

Nevertheless, Moorfield believes GoCar will be an appealing prospect for drivers, including existing UberX drivers; GoCar will take a 15% commission verses Uber's 20%. ""At the end of the day, drivers want to maximise their earnings,"" he said. ""They don't need to choose between the two platforms. We completely expect drivers to be on the two platforms.""

In any case, according to Moorfield, the two companies will not battle each other for the same small pool of people. In his view, there are plenty of potential customers and drivers who have not yet even heard of ride-sharing. 

""I think there's going to be a lot of working alongside [each other] to expand the size of the market, to raise awareness,"" he said. ""The ride-sharing market is still in its infancy.""

SEE ALSO: Listen to two black holes colliding in deep space""Most people think of black holes as exotic objects that 'suck in' all of the matter around them, and from which nothing, not even light, can escape,"" Aurora Simionescu, co-author of a new study detailing the Chandra discovery, said in a blog post. ""While this it is true that, once anything has fallen in 'over the edge' or so called 'event horizon' of the black hole, it can never leave it again, a lot of interesting physics happens right before matter gets swallowed forever.""It's possible that the particles in the black hole jet slam into microwave photons in the CMB, exciting them and ""boosting"" their energy up to the point where they glow in X-ray, NASA said. The origins of the jets are mysterious, but Simionescu added that some material that is about to fall into the black hole may be ""accelerated"" to great speeds and pushed away from the black hole, forming the jets.           ""Nobody understands the exact details of how this happens, but probably through a twisted geometry of the magnetic fields, some of the material swirling around just on the verge of falling into the black hole is sometimes accelerated in really energetic jets moving away from the black hole instead,"" Simionescu wrote.What exactly the jets are is still a mystery to scientists, as is how some jets are able to emit X-rays.Astronomers have studied plenty of jets from black holes in the nearby universe, but the jet in the B3 0727+409 is one of only a few X-ray-emitting jets seen in the far-off cosmos, Simionescu said.In astronomy, space and time are related. The light from an object in the distant universe like the black hole jet in B3 0727+409 took billions of years to reach Chandra's detectors, giving scientists some insight into what the strange jet looked like in X-ray wavelengths long ago, when the CMB was more intense.Usually, these objects are observed using radio wavelengths of light, which are far from X-rays on the spectrum of light, and according to Simionescu, the jet in this particular system seems to have very little signal in radio wavelengths.This new finding could have far-reaching implications for how scientists study black hole jets in the future as well.""If bright X-ray jets can exist with very faint or undetected radio counterparts,"" co-author Lukasz Stawarz said in a statement, ""it means that there could be many more of them out there because we haven’t been systematically looking for them.""Have something to add to this story?

"56cd03b5b589e46226000012","Nick Jaynes","Tech","Let me ask you a question. What's one less than 63? It's not 62 -- if you're going by Mercedes math, that is. No, apparently the answer is 43. As in, the new C43 Coupe, which is the all-new moniker for the performance C-Class Coupe positioned just below the C63 Coupe.

Confused? Well, I hate to tell you, we're not in the clear just yet. But before I dig into the confounding nitty-gritty, let's first look at this new coupe's details.

See also: This $245,495 Range Rover comes with a built-in gun case

Underneath the all-new C-Class Coupe body lies a 3.0-liter V6 Biturbo (German code for twin turbocharged) engine tuned by AMG, Mercedes' performance arm. As a result of its special performance treatment, it produces 362 horsepower and 382 pound-feet of torque. That power is routed to all four wheels through an AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive system by way of the new 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission shared with the 2017 SL-Class. As a result, the C43 Coupe will do 0 to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds.

Of course, being a new Mercedes, the C43 Coupe has loads of wonderful tech just like the C63 S Sedan I drove last year.

Mercedes says the C43 was built to compete with the BMW 435i xDrive Coupe and the Audi S5, which makes sense. Now here's where it gets confusing. Currently, beneath the aforementioned C63 Sedan in the lineup lies the C450 AMG Sedan (with the same 3.0 Biturbo V6, I might add). And that one recently replaced the C400, which sits atop the C300.

Granted '450' didn't mean much, since the car is powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine and produces 362 horsepower, but it was at least palatable. But, to me, 43 makes no sense. Clearly, it's just a number less than 63. However, it's less than 300. Clearly, Mercedes is just making it up as it goes along.

So until this moment, the order from least expensive to most, it went: 300, 450, 63 and 63 S. Now there's this 43 wedged in there somewhere ... but only on the Coupe side of the C-Class line. I have reached out for clarification from Mercedes on what the 43 means for the fate of 450 but I haven't yet received response.

Regardless of this exceedingly confusing -- and seemingly constant -- reshuffling of the Mercedes C-Class lineup, I really like the looks of this thing. When I first drove the C450 AMG I suggested that, if you weren't willing to step up to the full meal deal C63 S, you ought to just ignore the C63 and get the C450. Likely, the C43 will be just as good as the C450 but, you know, with two fewer doors (and a new transmission).

"56c1d4af97b2f8124b0013e7","Emily Blake","Entertainment","Clive Davis' 40th pre-Grammy gala on Sunday night was all about the many artists we've lost in the the past year -- in 2016 alone, even. But it wasn't a time to mourn; it was a reason to celebrate.

The crowd was packed -- ""There's more people in this room than have subscribed to Tidal in the past year,"" quipped James Corden. Caitlyn Jenner was there, Christina Aguilera was there, Jamie Foxx, Max Martin, Herbie Hancock and Sylvester Stallone, too.

See also: You won't believe who performed Lionel Richie songs at Grammys tribute

The first performance of the night was a tribute to David Bowie, who undoubtedly paved the way for many of the musicians in the room. Beck and Nirvana alums Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear joined together for a performance of ""The Man Who Sold the World,"" Beck at the mic, Grohl on the drums.

Fetty Wap may not have been entirely in his element performing ""Trap Queen"" in front of a crowd that included Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer, but it was fun nonetheless -- probably because it's ""Trap Queen,"" after all -- and a welcome respite from a lineup short on modern-day hits. When he told Davis ""thank you"" at the end of the performance, he still seemed a little shocked he was there.

Then everyone was a little surprised when Barry Manilow took the stage, just days after being hospitalized with complications from a surgery and postponing his tour. He sang ""Mandy,"" which was also celebrating a 40-year anniversary. He brought Judy Garland to the stage (in a way) by performing ""Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart"" off his dream duets album, in which he sings alongside various artists' recordings from the past; i.e., a hologram performance without the hologram.

Melissa Etheridge followed with a tribute to The Eagles' Glenn Frey, who died in January at age 67, with a performance of ""Take It to the Limit,"" channeling the guitar legend's soothing stage presence.

Carly Simon warned the room ""I haven't performed in a while,"" but you couldn't tell from her performance of ""You're So Vain."" And 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Chicago gave equally energetic performances with ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"" and ""25 or 6 to 4.""

But the highlight of the night came when Earth, Wind & Fire took the stage and poured some much-needed funk and soul into the affair. They may have lost singer Maurice White just this month, but it didn't keep them from having fun and bringing the entire room to their feet. The loss was fresh, yes, but it only made the performance that much more passionate as they danced their way through hits ""Keep Your Head to the Sky,"" ""In the Stone,"" ""Fantasy,"" ""Shining Star,"" ""September"" and ""That's the Way of the World.""

Then Davis opened the stage for younger artists Andra Day, Tori Kelly and Elle King. While King struggled to hit the high notes of ""Ex's and Oh's,"" Day gave a stirring performance of her empowerment anthem track ""Rise Up."" Kelly opted for a stripped-down acoustic performance of ""Should've Been Us"" that displayed her chasmic range.

Adam Lambert and Jack Antonoff wrapped up the show with another tribute to Bowie with ""Let's Dance,"" and, as though instructed by the Thin White Duke himself, everyone did just that.

A list of film credits will scroll beneath Oscar-winners' acceptance speeches during this year's telecast, a move meant to encourage speakers to focus on something more meaningful than just a list of names.

The change -- the first time the Academy Awards producers has tried what many have suggested -- was announced Monday at the annual Oscar Nominees Luncheon in Beverly Hills.

All the nominees are being required to submit a list of whom they'd like to thank in the scroll, which will be displayed beneath their acceptance speech. That doesn't mean they can't give verbal shout-outs -- it just means they have an excuse to use their moment for another purpose.

This could mean more entertaining moments at the dais -- and certainly more political ones. Equal pay was the hot topic at last year's ceremony, which Patricia Arquette seized upon in her winning moment. 

With #OscarsSoWhite coming around for a second dip and thank-yous ostensibly out of the way, expect more of that same political fire for the ceremony, set for Feb. 28.

Republican State Sen. Patty Ritchie also wants to prevent people from using food stamps to buy non-nutritional food such as cake. 

See also: 6 welfare myths we all need to stop believing

""The goal of this legislation is to improve dietary quality and reduce obesity,"" the proposed bill states. ""This measure will also restrict the abuse of the program."" 

   New York State Senate

The legislation suggests different foods and drinks that may be off-limits to food stamp users if the bill passes, but those items aren't final. The Office of Temporarily Disability Assistance would have to come up with an official list. 

""The purpose of [food stamps] is to promote good nutrition, but current rules allow the purchase of junk food and luxury items like high-end steaks and lobster,"" the bill states. ""Even certain energy drinks, which are subject to sales tax, can be purchased using taxpayer-funded benefit cards.""

Ritchie's bill spends a lot of time on obesity prevention, even though a person receiving food stamps is allotted only about $1.41 per person for each meal. 

""In New York and throughout the United States, obesity has reached epidemic proportions,"" the bill states. ""The goal of this legislation is to improve dietary quality and reduce obesity by ensuring food and beverage items purchased using public benefit cards have been declared exempt by the Department of Taxation and Finance.

Democrats in New York and elsewhere have traditionally been opposed to restrictions on purchases for those using food stamps. Democrats control the New York State Assembly, meaning the bill is not likely to get off the ground.

Editors' note: A previous version of this story reported that people had once been able to use food stamps to gamble or purchase alcohol. This is incorrect. Assistance provided by a program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families can be used to purchase more than food.

...according to the Internet, at least. But you know who doesn't love these assessments of Oliver's work? That's right: John Oliver himself.

Last week, Mashable asked the Daily Show alum at a press event if he's looking forward to another year of headlines about his remarkable destructive powers when the third season of Last Week Tonight premieres Feb. 14. Before the question could even be completed, Oliver jumped in, shaking his head like a disappointed teacher.

""No, no, no,"" he said. ""Every one of those makes me sad."" (Except maybe when they're about him literally destroying a piñata.)

Oliver made clear that he doesn't want to be known for obliteration, or decimation, or extermination. Why? Because ""we're done with the show once we're done [with an episode],"" he said. ""I have to accept I cannot control what happens to it, how it’s repackaged out in the world. But we’re not looking for the level of disembowelment to be the defining characteristic of our week’s work.""

He made clear as well that he and his staff don't consciously chase stories that they believe will hit big with online audiences -- even though the show consistently manages to do just that.

Enormous view counts for segments like Oliver's explanation of net neutrality are ""a completely accidental byproduct,"" Oliver said. ""We certainly did not intend for anything to ever go viral. I don’t think you could look at the ingredients of anything we do and think that is a recipe for mass popularity.""

Instead, Oliver simply hopes his show will be known for continuing to do what it does best: spinning comic gold out of apparently dull straw. 

""It seemed really fun to do those boring stories and make them funny,"" said the host, explaining his and executive producer Tim Carvell's original goal for Last Week Tonight. ""That was pretty much the sum total of our idea, was 'let’s maybe try and look at some [less obvious] stories so we’re not just being reactive to the news cycle. And let’s try and make this not the worst decision in the history of HBO.""

Oliver was coy when asked if he could give any hints about what viewers can expect him to absolutely eradicate take on this year. ""I like the idea of it being a surprise, like with the Snowden thing,"" he said. ""I like the idea that the show, you don’t know necessarily what we’re going to talk about each week. That’s kind of a fun thing.""

Although actually, Last Week Tonight's third year could be its most exciting -- and controversial -- yet. When a reporter brought up the massive popularity of true crime series like Making a Murderer and asked Oliver if he has any plans to address that topic on his show, Oliver had an excellent response:

""I committed a murder, and I’m basically going to try to use the criminal justice system to get out of it,"" he joked, before comparing this theoretical bit to one of his series' most ambitious and memorable segments ever. ""That’s going to be our church this year: I'm going to wriggle out of a murder.""

He wasn't being serious, we think -- but wouldn't you totally watch if he were?

Season 3 of Last Week Tonight debuts Sunday on HBO.

"56ccf4b4b05f9d7a91000002","Christopher Miller","World","The conviction of a Chinese-American former New York Police officer who shot to death an unarmed black man has spawned protests from Asian-Americans and caused a rift within their community over whether he had been targeted because of his race.

Last Saturday, some 10,000 people, mostly Chinese-Americans, demonstrated in support of Peter Liang, the 28-year-old rookie cop who shot and killed Akai Gurley, 28, in a dark stairwell of the Louis Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn in November 2014.

The demonstrators gathered on a lawn across from the Brooklyn courthouse where Liang was convicted. Many held signs that read ""One tragedy, two victims"" and chanted ""No scapegoat! No scapegoat!"" 

They said Liang was discriminated against, unjustly convicted and used as a scapegoat. They claimed the evidence against him was not as clear-cut as recent cases in which white police officers killed unarmed black people, faced similar charges and walked free.
 
""All the policemen have no punishment for all they did,"" 30-year-old Tommy Shi, a Manhattan resident who works in a restaurant told The New York Times at Saturday's protest. ""Peter Liang is a scapegoat for all this... That's why we stand for Peter Liang.""

Last week, the jury came back with a guilty verdict for Liang -- the first NYPD officer convicted in a line-of-duty shooting in over a decade -- after two days of deliberation. 

The prosecution had argued that Liang's actions were reckless and led directly to Gurley's death. The young officer's defense attorneys said the shooting was a tragedy but argued that Liang had not committed a crime in performing his duties.

During the trial, both Liang's partner and Gurley's girlfriend testified against him. They told jurors Liang was more worried about how his job might be affected than providing medical assistance to Gurley, who was dying on the floor.

Many demonstrators on Saturday reportedly said they believe that Liang accidentally fired his gun. Liang had his weapon drawn as he and his partner patrolled the Louis Pink Houses. As Liang opened a door in the stairwell of the building, his gun fired, and a bullet ricocheted off a wall and struck Gurley.

Writing for The Huffington Post, Steph Yin, a Chinese-American, said she was ""disappointed by those in my community who rallied this weekend in support of Peter Liang."" 

She said: ""My parents see Peter Liang as a victim of the mounting pressures of Black Lives Matter. They are calling him a 'scapegoat,' particularly as Akai Gurley's death happened just four months after Eric Garner's death.""

While she opposes the protesters, rather than blaming Liang, she places the responsibility for Gurley's death on a ""rotten system that Liang was part of"" -- a system in which ""police routinely conduct unwarranted public housing patrols just to look for suspicious activity.""

Annie Tan, an Asian-American writing on Medium who sided with Yin, said she hoped the event would start a dialogue among Asian-Americans.

""I urge my Chinese American and Asian American communities to think long and hard about which side of history we are on and what it means to support Officer Liang,"" Tan said.

"56c339e812d2cd21df00037d","Megan Specia","World","Feminists in France are boycotting Starbucks because the company allegedly had a sign in one of its Saudi Arabia locations that banned women from its store.

According to a report from Cosmopolitan, the religious police asked the cafe to stop women from entering after they noticed the wall used to separate male and female customers -- known as a ""gender barrier"" -- was not in place.

The protest comes after an image of a sign in a Starbucks window, allegedly taken in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was widely shared on Twitter. At least one of the photos dates back to 2015, but the recirculation of the signs in Arabic and English that appear on the window of the coffee shop telling women not to enter ignited outrage and prompted the French protest. 

The signs reads: ""Please no entry for ladies, only send your drivers to order. Thank you.""

Saudi women are expected to have drivers because it's illegal for women to drive in the country as part of a strict set of discriminatory religious guidelines that limit their freedoms. The country's male guardianship system forbids women from getting a passport, marrying, traveling or accessing higher education without the approval of a male guardian -- usually their husband, father, brother or son.

French feminist group Osez le Féminisme organized a protest at a Starbucks on the Boulevard Saint Michel in Paris.

The same group started a petition, asking for signatures from those who pledge to boycott Starbucks over the sign. By Tuesday morning, the petition had more than 12,000 signatures. 

""We outraged citizens, call on Starbucks Coffee consumers to boycott all the cafes,"" over the sign in the Riyadh cafe. ""The dignity of human beings and the female half of humanity is not negotiable!""

They encouraged women to take part in the conversation using the hashtag #Girlcott.

A Starbucks spokesperson confirmed to Cosmopolitan that the cafe in the Jarir bookstore in Riyadh underwent renovations in order to build a divide to cater to single women and men as well as families. The company said it ""adheres to the local customs by providing separate entrances for families as well as single people.""

""All our stores provide equal amenities, service, menu, and seating to men, women and families. We are working as quickly as possible as we refurbish our Jarir store, so that we may again welcome all customers in accordance with local customs,"" read the statement. 

The company quickly followed up with a revised statement later in the week that confirmed ""the store is now accessible to single men on one side as well as women and families on the other side.""

Starbucks has 78 stores in Saudi Arabia and ""all stores cater to both families and singles, except for one that is exclusively reserved for women and families.""

LONDON -- Margaery Tyrell has a rough season ahead of her as Game of Thrones returns, the actress who plays her has revealed.

The character has lost control and is ""not in charge of her destiny"" as the show returns in April, Natalie Dormer told Radiotimes.com Thursday.

Tyrell, who was last seen languishing in a prison cell and telling Cersei what she thought of her, has not seen her condition improve. In new photos released from the show she's still imprisoned and not enjoying life by the looks of it.

""In Season 6 — when we finally get there at the end of April — what you see with Margaery is that the reigns have been taken away from her,"" Dormer said. ""So it’s like she’s not in charge of her destiny any more. And if she’s not in charge of her destiny how does she reclaim that power you see her wield for the first few years?""

She's not the only one in the family with problems, with brother Loras arrested and Lady Olenna left alone. ""To see the Tyrells in that kind of jeopardy, to see them incarcerated like that and how they deal with that, I do think it’s a very interesting arc for them this season,"" she added. ""It really shakes it up, King's Landing has been completely shaken up this season.""

Dormer also told the magazine that she was relishing playing a character that has lost control.

""I’ve had the gift of playing women who seem to be quite in control in recent years, whether it's Cressida [from Hunger Games] or Anne Boleyn [in The Tudors],"" she insisted, ""and it’s very liberating to play someone who’s losing their shit.""

"56c21784b05f9d65990017d3","Andrew Freedman","World","The sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday may mean that President Obama's Clean Power Plan to combat manmade global warming is more likely to remain intact. The plan, which consists of EPA limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new and preexisting power plants, forms the centerpiece of Obama's agenda to limit global warming. Without the Clean Power Plan, it would be nearly impossible for the U.S. to live up to the emissions reduction pledges it made as part of the Paris Agreement struck in December, in which the U.S. said it would cut emissions by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.SEE ALSO: How the Clean Power Plan could vastly change the way you get electricityIt was only about a week ago that the Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, temporarily halted the implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending the resolution of legal challenges to the constitutionality of the regulations. More than two-dozen states, along with corporations and industry groups, were in favor of such a stay while they work to halt the EPA's regulations entirely. This marked the first time in history that the Supreme Court had issued a stay on regulation prior to a federal appeals court review. The court's move was interpreted by many as a shot across the bow of the Obama administration to indicate the conservative majority's willingness to strike down the regulations once they reach the court in 2017 at the earliest. Justice Scalia was among the majority of justices that voted to issue that stay. Without him, it would not have halted the ruling.The court's decision also called into question the ability of the United States to live up to the climate commitments it made in Paris in December as part of a landmark global climate agreement, since without the Clean Power Plan in place, it's unlikely the U.S. could reduce its emissions by up to 28% by 2025. Under the Clean Power Plan, the EPA seeks to cut planet-warming carbon pollution from power plants by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030, through a system of flexible state plans to regulate pollution from power plants and other facilities.The ruling caught environmentalists and foes of the plan by surprise. ""Today's Supreme Court order to halt those regulations -- regulations that attack the middle class and won't even have a meaningful impact on global carbon emissions -- is just the latest sign they may not be [legal],"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, praising the Supreme Court's move.""It was totally unexpected and unprecedented, and I think both sides of the case were surprised, us shocked to lose, the other side probably shocked to win on this step, but it is only a temporary halt,"" David Doniger, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's (NRDC) clean air and climate program, told E&E TV. The NRDC was closely involved with the formulation of the Clean Power Plan.""We have a strong position and we think the D.C. Circuit will uphold the rule,"" Doniger said. ""Then the Supreme Court will have its look on the merits.""Scalia's climate historyThe Clean Air Plan was developed after the administration tried and failed to get legislation through congress that would have addressed greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the Obama White House turned to its regulatory authorities by relying on the  EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as a ""pollutant"" under the Clean Air Act. That authority dates back to the 2007 Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA.Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in that case, and during oral arguments he expressed his view that climate change was a distinct issue compared to other air pollutants that EPA has long had authority over, such as mercury and the deadly components of smog.Here is a section of the transcript, in which Scalia spars with James R. Milkey, who was arguing on behalf of Massachusetts, which was seeking to force the EPA to regulate greenhouse gasses. Scalia: To be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an air pollutant. If we fill this room with carbon dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers health. But I always thought an air pollutant was something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and your claim here is not that the pollution of what we normally call ""air"" is endangering health. That isn't, that isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is contributing to global warming. Milkey: Respectfully, Your Honor, it is not the stratosphere. It's the troposphere. Scalia: Troposphere, whatever. I told you before I'm not a scientist. (Laughter.) Scalia: That's why I don't want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.In his dissent, Scalia wrote that the growing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a marked departure from other air pollutants that come under the EPA's authority, stating: ...""Regulating the buildup of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, which is alleged to be causing global climate change, is not akin to regulating the concentration of some substance that is polluting the air.""Scalia also wrote that the Clean Air Act should be interpreted by the EPA, rather than having the court decide how the EPA should interpret that law.""The Court’s alarm over global warming may or may not be justified,but it ought not distort the outcome of this litigation,"" he wrote. ""This is a straightforward administrative-law case, in which Congress has passed a malleable statute giving broad discretion, not to us but to an executive agency. No matter how important the underlying policy issues at stake, this Court has no business substituting its own desired outcome for the reasoned judgment of the responsible agency.""          Here is Scalia explaining his dissent in the EPA  case, via video in a 2012 appearance at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute, in which he says, ""I don't do science, I do law.""A friendlier climate on the Supreme Court?With Scalia's death, however, the likelihood that the nation's highest court will strike down the Clean Power Plan now drops significantly, though exactly how low the odds are will depend on the new justice's views on the subject.  Two scenarios are suddenly in play. The first is that the regulations are upheld by the more liberal D.C. Circuit Court, which will hear arguments on June 2, and then are appealed to the Supreme Court, where Scalia's seat may still vacant for much of the 2016-2017 term. If this is the case, justices would likely deadlock on a 4-to-4 vote, which would leave the lower court's ruling in place, and allow the regulations to go forward. The wild card possibility is what happens if the case reaches the Supreme Court when a new justice -- either someone appointed by President Obama or his successor -- has taken their seat on the bench. Even if a Republican president appoints a conservative justice in 2017, the odds are that they may be at least a little friendlier toward climate change regulations than Scalia was, simply because Scalia was so extreme on this issue. For environmentalists, industry interests and international diplomats alike, an open Supreme Court seat will make the 2016 election even more critical from a climate policy perspective. ",0.106971500721501,0.492814073681421,"http://mashable.com/2016/02/15/scalia-obama-climate-plan/",1241,13,92,2,9,1,1,"2016-02-15T18:22:17+00:00",955,9,"Without Scalia, Obama's climate plan may have a better chance of survival",0.5,0.5,"clean power plan, Climate, greenhouse gases, Paris Agreement, Paris Climate Summit, Politics, scalia, World","rising"

"56bba3abb589e44191000038","Saba Hamedy","Entertainment","Editors note: Part of a series featuring each new original show or movie debuting on YouTube Red. The subscription streaming service's first slate of originals launched Wednesday.

LOS ANGELES -- The Chinese Theatre has long been the place to host the biggest Hollywood premieres, from from Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings in 1927 to George Lucas' first Star Wars in 1977 -- and that Force Awakens premiere, ""the biggest thing Hollywood has ever seen.""

Now, in a sign of the entertainment industry's changing times, the storied Hollywood Blvd. venue is adding a different kind of movie: A YouTube Original. 

SEE ALSO: A day in the incredibly popular life of YouTube star Lilly Singh

On Wednesday, the day it launches on YouTube's subscription streaming service Red, Lilly Singh's documentary A Trip To Unicorn Island  will also get a ritzy red carpet rollout at the iconic Hollywood venue.

It's the biggest premiere yet for a digital film release -- by far. 

While a handful of digital movies have seen huge success on iTunes, Netflix and other platforms, they have all held smaller debut events, mostly at theaters in Westwood by the UCLA campus. For Singh's film, which was produced by Astronauts Wanted, hundreds of people -- including YouTube creators, digital industry players and hundreds of fans -- are expected to fill the theater seats. 

The film, directed by Scott Winn, follows Singh's journey on her 26-city tour around the world. The Canadian-Indian digital star has amassed nearly 7 million subscribers and over 880 million views on her ""Superwoman"" YouTube channel since launching it in 2010.

""I think I knew it was going to be a life-changing experience,"" Singh told Mashable. ""I make every video Monday and Thursday in my room, and I love doing it. But being on a stage around the world with people, not just with the screen, was challenging. I knew I wanted to document it not only for the audience but for myself.""

It certainly showcases all sides of ""Super Woman,"" including darker moments often not captured on her video blog. For example, the documentary shows footage of Singh breaking down, which she said happened on just day two of filming the documentary. 

""Having a camera crew there, I had to embrace the idea of living in the moment and letting them capture that,"" she said. ""I think one of the most relatable things about Super Woman is that she’s very human, she talks about her pimples her muffin top her unshaved legs. So with this documentary, if I was sad, I showed I was sad.""

While this type of digital documentary style film has been done before -- most recently with Tyler Oakley's Snervous -- the ramped up marketing efforts for A Trip to Unicorn Island has led to increased mainstream buzz, more so than other digital film releases.

YouTube teased its originals, including Singh's documentary, at Sundance Film Festival last month. Astronauts Wanted also collaborated to produce and release an immersive virtual reality experience of one of Singh's concerts -- at The Warfield in San Francisco -- available on the Jaunt VR app.

Singh -- who is plastered all over billboards in major U.S. cities -- has also been a guest on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, The Today Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  

There was even a Snapchat filter on the day of YouTube Red's original launch specifically promoting Singh's documentary.

""When we started out with this company, we had aspirations to work with this really interesting new generation of creators and the top talent if we could,"" Judy McGrath, founder and president of Astronauts Wanted, told Mashable. ""We found Lilly and we were all instantly transfixed by her. To us she represents so many of things that we thought reflects this generation.""

Singh is also confident that fans will pay to see her in a different format.

""It’s my first feature-length format,"" Singh said. ""This is storytelling in a different way that they [my fans] are not used to I think they are excited to see how that unfolds.""

The nearly 1,000-seat Chinese Theater would not disclose its fee, but with nightly rental, production, permits and security, it's not cheap. But the historic venue is more than happy to play host.

""Something like this YouTube Red film obviously has a huge audience, and Lilly has such a huge following. It’s something her fans want to see on a big screen and we are happy to support that,"" Alwyn Hight Kushner, president and COO of TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX, told Mashable. ""We've done lot of kind of alternative, indie film premieres and even premieres for some TV shows. The whole film industry is changing. It’s an exciting new frontier.""

"56bf3c4797b2f8124b00062e","Liza Hearon","Entertainment","LONDON -- The chief executive of the Baftas said the British film industry's top honours do not feature enough black and minority nominees.

With one black star among the nominees in the four major acting categories -- Idris Elba -- the Baftas are marginally more diverse than the Oscars, which hasn't nominated a person of colour for an acting award for two years. But that's not enough, Amanda Berry told the Telegraph.

She said she supports a ""Baftas Blackout"" protest planned for before Sunday evening's EE British Academy Film Awards ceremony at London's Royal Opera House.

Berry blamed the film industry for not creating opportunities for black and minority talent.

“Not enough films are being made with diverse talent in front of the camera. Our industry isn’t diverse enough, so the pool of people to draw award winners from isn’t diverse enough. I want the awards to be as diverse as they possibly can be. But people can only vote on what they’ve seen,” she said.

The British Academy of Film and Television Arts is seeking to make its membership more diverse, similar to the changes planned by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the Oscars.

An anonymous, voluntary survey was sent to the 6,500 voting Bafta members two days after the announcement of the Oscar nominations. It asks about details like age, gender, ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. The results of the survey will be known later this year and the organisation will put forward proposals. 

Berry told the Guardian that Bafta has long recognised that the industry isn't diverse, and has been ""working away in the background, probably too quietly."" 

""So what we have done is set up 15 new talent initiatives and mentoring schemes and scholarships and made diversity an absolute priority,” she said.

However, she won't claim that Baftas are more diverse than the Oscars.

“It would be inappropriate for me to say that we've done a better job than the Oscars. I admire their stance. They've said that they're going to make changes. They know it isn't good enough. I don’t want to gloat and say we’ve done better, because it could’ve gone the other way. I can't control who's nominated,” she told the Telegraph.

The organisation has asked more ethnic minority stars to present awards and appear at the ceremony.

“We always try to make sure that we deliver a programme that has as diverse a cast as possible. And the presenters are something that we can control,” Berry said.

Bridge of Spies and Carol led the Bafta nominations, with nine each. See the full list of Bafta nominees here.

The famous rainbow-colored bagels of The Bagel Store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn have become a phenomenon lately. So much so that the demand has overpowered the supply, leading the store owner and impassioned bagel chef Scot Rossillo to shut down the restaurant indefinitely.

Rolled with several layers of multicolored dough and often topped with a Funfetti cream cheese schmear, Rossillo's amazing technicolor bagels attracted long lines around the block up until the shop's closure last Saturday.

"56c1b25397b2f8124b0012d2","Tim Chester","Watercooler","LONDON -- A clever Reddit user has created one of the greatest DIY Harry Potter projects ever: A fully functional, digital recreation of the Weasley family's clock.

The timepiece, which is housed in the shell of an old antique clock and stuffed full of wires and LEDs, was created by user tbornottb3. It communicates with the family's smartphones to periodically update on their location.

See also: Rupert Grint betrays Ron Weasley, says he didn't enjoy kissing Emma Watson in 'Harry Potter'

The Weasley's clock stood in their living room at The Burrow and featured nine hands, one for each member of the household. Instead of telling the time, it pointed to various locations pinpointing members of the family, including home, school, work, travelling, lost, hospital, prison and mortal peril.

The options on the replica clock's dial meanwhile are home, work, holiday, forest, on the way, and - of course - mortal peril. What triggers the latter? ""Whatever each person wanted,"" the creator explains. ""For example, my sister has it triggered by a forecast of too-cold weather, and I have it triggered by the radius of our rival school.""

The clock was built between Thanksgiving and Christmas last year, and unveiled online Sunday. The project began with the shell of a broken old clock from an antique store.

Then plans were mapped out on a scrap of paper and given to a friend who translated it all onto Adobe Illustrator.

The creators then ""laser cut / etched those vectors onto wood."" Another photo shows the inside workings of the clock. A Particle Photon connects via a breadboard to an addressable LED strip, its creator says.

There was a fair amount of coding involved.

The system uses the If This Then That (IFTTT) web service, that allows users to connect different applications via a chain of conditional statements called recipes. 

""I used IFTTT to define radii that would send messages to the Photon if my phone entered or exited them,"" the creator explains. All six family members follow the same process. 

""Most of the rules are location-based (setting me to WORK if I enter my university library, HOME if I enter my dorm), but you can set other triggers too (set me to HOLIDAY if the forecast calls for snow, set me to MORTAL PERIL if the stock of the company I'll be working for next year drops too low).""

This is the view from the back of the clock:

And the finished product:

The big letter 'B' is lit by the bottom of the LED strand and illuminates a different colour for each member of the family as the clock is about to update their position.

Fingers crossed someone at Warner Bros commissions this for mass production.

"56bb283597b2f876df00076d","Saba Hamedy","Entertainment","PALOS VERDES, Calif. -- While it may be one of the craziest elections in history, Katie Couric doesn't miss covering it for network news.

Much.

""It's different,"" the Yahoo Global News anchor told Mashable in a candid interview just before Yahoo's foreboding fourth-quarter earnings were announced last week. ""Because we're sort of a scrappy, smaller organization [at Yahoo News], we don't have the layers a network news organization has. Sometimes I miss those layers, but other times I think I've been able to do things like 45-minute interviews with candidates [and] explainers -- those are fun for me to do.""

See also: Marissa Mayer might finally sell Yahoo

The 2016 election marks Couric's first political cycle on a digital screen rather than behind a network news desk. The Sunnyvale, California-based tech company hired Couric back in 2013, with high hopes that the media superstar could become the face of Yahoo News.

Over the last two years, Couric has brought notoriety to the platform -- and page views -- but Yahoo is still struggling across the board. Last Tuesday the company reported a 15% workforce reduction (around 1,700 employees) and ""strategic alternatives,"" which could mean a sale.

Still, Couric, 59, doesn't let Yahoo's situation phase her. She focuses on what she does best: storytelling. 

Going digital

""Yahoo may be a sort of a legacy tech company but they are still in the process of figuring out and understanding media,"" she told Mashable. ""Understanding how to position it, how to promote it, how to distribute it. I think we’ve made some strides but we have a lot of work to do in terms of making sure [our content] gets to the right audience.""

At the Terranea Resort in Palos Verdes last week, Couric sat barefoot on her hotel room couch prepping for a politics-themed panel at the AOL Makers Conference. The three-day event's sessions focused on tangible solutions and calls-to-action around gender equality.

She clutched her notes, reciting questions she would ask later that night, and moved one foot under the other to sit more comfortably. Her phone buzzed at least six times over the course of 30 minutes. Scattered around the coffee table was a pair of sunglasses, a water bottle, a small can of hairspray and a copy of a recent issue of the New York Times. 

Blue heels -- which she later showed off to the conference crowd -- were placed adjacent to the table.

Many wondered why Couric ditched the spotlight of network news (NBC News from 1989-2006, CBS from 2006-2011 and ABC from 2011-2014) for a gig of so many unknowns. 

This was the anchor who got an exclusive interview with then-Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. (Yep, the one that helped inspire the famous Saturday Night Live ""I can see Russia from my house!"" joke).

""There is vast real estate that’s available to you online, and it seems like there’s a huge appetite now,"" she said. ""The downside of that is there’s so much stuff out there. How do you get noticed? How do you get people to consume what you are working on? So that is also a challenge.""

Couric craved the flexibility

""I was curious about so many different things that I thought it would be fun to go to a place that didn’t necessarily pigeonhole you or put you in a box and allowed you to kind of exercise all these different muscles and things you’re curious about. I thought, where could I go where I could sort of satisfy all the sides of me?"" she said, laughing. ""It sounds so cheesy.""

Maybe so, but it's accurate. 

While at Yahoo, Couric has sat down with everyone from YouTube star PewDiePie to Republican politician Sen. Marco Rubio. She even spoke at VidCon, the three-day digital video conference in Anaheim that's a huge draw for teens.

Her video segments focus on three different areas: explanatory journalism (short, sharable weekly offerings), interviews (with diverse subjects) and ""World 3.0"" (uplifting series that focuses on innovators).

Beyond that, Couric also covers breaking news, broadcasting live during events such as the State of the Union. The core team for the news video division at Yahoo is about a couple of dozen people. 

Mayer continues to highlight Couric as an asset to the company. In a recent letter from the CEO to the staff, which was independently obtained by Mashable, the executive wrote: 

“When you think of Yahoo, you should think of news ... with Katie Couric as one of our most trusted voices, we’ll be a differentiated platform that deeply engages users on topics that impassion them and that inspires vibrant conversation.”

Others echo the significance of her presence at the platform. By the end of December, Couric's videos generated twice as many views as the same time period in 2014. 

Her videos were also watched, on average, for more time than other videos on Yahoo News, averaging 5 to 6 million streams per week. As of 2015, her videos have generated over 250 million views.
 
Her interviews with 2016 Presidential candidate contenders have amassed 15 million video streams to date. Yahoo also had nearly half a million viewers live for coverage of the results for the Iowa Caucus as they happened in prime time.

""Katie broke new ground for news anchors when she made the move to Yahoo,"" Martha Nelson, Global Editor in Chief at Yahoo, told Mashable in an email statement. ""She had the foresight and imagination to see that Yahoo, a global digital media platform, would help her reach a massive audience while also allowing her the freedom to experiment with new forms of journalism and storytelling.” 

Such praise, however, doesn't necessarily mean Couric is Yahoo's savior -- it takes a lot more than clicks to fix a struggling company. Plus some argue she doesn't bring as much value to Yahoo as she costs them. Her reported salary is a whopping $10 million a year. 

One marketing analytics company, Jumpshot, reported that Couric's videos only drive about 5% of homepage visitors, lagging two to four times behind the top three most popular digital magazines: Yahoo TV (20-25% of homepage visitors), Yahoo Celebrity and Yahoo Movies (both drive 10-15% of traffic). Their data, which was pulled between July and December 2015, also suggests Couric's channel has the second lowest millennial viewership at only 7%.

Peter Csathy, CEO of Manatt Digital Media, Mashable said though Couric was a valuable addition to Yahoo's then-growing team, the company's disorganization ultimately did not bode in her favor.

""Katie Couric has a brand name -- she's widely liked, respected, recognized,"" Csathy said. ""While that is great, to what end? That's the issue here: What is the strategy here for Yahoo? What's the demographic? What's the play they are going for and how does Couric fit into that and drive that strategy? An asset without a company strategy does not lead to success.""

Csathy pointed to how Yahoo axed its video service, Screen, earlier this year, leaving an even more disorganized video division.

""Here you have this brand name [Couric] but you shut down the place her content was going to live, so she's essentially been made virtually invisible and hard to find,"" he said.

Noteworthy notoriety 

The buzz around her name alone, as well as the exclusives she scores for the platform, has still been enough to elevate Yahoo -- at least when it comes to news coverage. 

Brands are increasingly partnering with Yahoo to sponsor Couric's content. Yahoo signed deals with Merrill Edge (which sponsors Couric's ""Now I Get It"" series) and with Nissan  (which sponsors Couric's interview series ""World 3.0""). More recently, H&R Block signed on to sponsor one of Couric's new programs called ""Cities Rising: Rebuilding America.""  

Back at the Makers Conference, though Couric was surrounded by a slew of other prominent public figures -- including Gloria Steinem, America Ferrera and Caitlyn Jenner -- many approached the journalist first. Countless guests, all women from across all industries, asked to shake her hand or to take a selfie. 

Even other celebrities couldn't help but smile for a group photo.

See also: Hold on, grandpa. The world's fastest mobility scooter just did 107 mph.

Do you and one friend need to go anywhere -- right now? You'll need the Sherp ATV. It's a two-passenger, diesel-powered wilderness-squasher with patented self-inflating tires.

With those massive chunks of rubber at each corner, and nearly encompassing the entire side of the truck, the Sherp can easily roll over obstacles as big as 27.5 inches tall. Though, I suspect that's a conservative estimate. If there's anything conservative about this thing, that is. 

Although it has a small 1.5-liter diesel engine that produces a minuscule 44 horsepower, the Sherp weighs about as much as a Toyota Corolla, so it's just enough to get it up to its 28 mph top speed on land. On water it'll do 3.7 mph. While not much, that's a lot more than the aforementioned Corolla can do on water.

Here's the part where you expect me to tell you that you won't be able to buy one. Wrong! $65,000 will get you the pickup Sherp with a canvas top. For $70,000, however, you can get the fully enclosed hardtop. If you do buy and anticipate icy water crossings, I recommend the hardtop.

Speaking to the AFP in Damascus, Assad said his army would try to retake all of Syria ""without any hesitation."" 

""It makes no sense for us to say that we will give up any part,"" he added.

He admitted that the involvement of regional players ""means that the solution will take a long time and will incur a heavy price.""

Assad was referring to Saudi Arabia, which said this week that it was preparing to send ground forces to Syria to fight against the regime, which is backed by Iranian militiamen.

#BREAKING: AFP EXCLUSIVE: Syria's Assad vows to retake whole country, warns could 'take long time'— AFP news agency (@AFP) February 12, 2016

Assad also rebuffed war crime allegations by the United Nations, calling them ""politicized."" 

The U.N. has said the leader is responsible for crimes against humanity, including tens of thousands of deaths that have come as a result of the nearly five-year-long war.

#BREAKING: AFP EXCLUSIVE: Syria's Assad rejects UN war crimes claims— AFP news agency (@AFP) February 12, 2016

A Syrian human rights group on Thursday estimated the death toll to be about 470,000 people. More than 11 million others have been displaced since the war began. Many have fled to Europe in what's become the largest migration of people to the continent since World War II.

Assad's comments cast doubt on the ceasefire agreed overnight by American, Russian and U.N. leaders even before it is implemented.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a joint message with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, told reporters just after midnight in Munich on Friday that a ""cessation of hostilities"" would begin ""within a week.""

Experts were quick to criticize the deal, saying a complete ceasefire in Syria is unlikely, since extremists form the Islamic State and al-Nusra Front groups -- both considered ""terrorist organizations"" by the U.S. and Russia -- were not involved in the talks and will likely continue fighting for territory. 

Plus, Assad appears set on continuing his Aleppo offensive, where the Syrian army, backed by Russia's air force, has virtually encircled rebels and severed their main supply route to the Turkish border.

""The main battle is about cutting the road between Aleppo and Turkey, for Turkey is the main conduit of supplies for the terrorists,"" Assad told AFP.

The offensive seemed to still be underway on Friday, with dozens of Russian airstrikes hitting neighborhoods around Aleppo, according to Syria Civil Defense, a volunteer search and rescue group.

Deadpool didn't start out as the merc with a mouth we all know and love. When he first appeared -- in an issue of New Mutants in 1991 -- he was hired to kill main character Cable (remember that name). 

At this point he was a more straightforward mercenary, though still a talkative one, and was largely modeled on the DC Comics villain Deathstroke the Terminator. Deathstroke's real name, Slade Wilson, inspired Deadpool's name of Wade Wilson; they have enhanced agility and strength in common. 

Original creators Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza get some call-outs in the movie via street names; Liefeld's name can be seen in the opening on a coffee cup belonging to someone Deadpool kills. (Liefeld is a controversial figure in comics, so his namesake dying made me particularly happy.) 

Don't worry about reading this early stuff. All you need to know about Deadpool's origins is that Wade Wilson was formerly U.S. Army Special Forces. He was given a rapid healing ability by the shadowy Weapon X program (the same guys who gave Wolverine his metal skeleton) after being diagnosed with cancer, and is deformed by his mutation, as in the movie. 

Still, most of what makes him Deadpool -- and most of what we see in the movie -- is based on the character's later appearances. And that's where you should start your reading.

Begin at the (sort of) beginning

Writer Joe Kelly joined Team Deadpool in 1997 with artist Ed McGuinness for a solo 'pool series. This era of Deadpool created most of the character you saw in the movie: breaking the fourth wall for asides to the audience, living with Blind Al, his relationship with Vanessa (who's actually a shapeshifter known as Copycat). 

Since Kelly and McGuinness pretty much expected the series to be cancelled, they had the freedom to do whatever they wanted. And we're all the better for it. 

In Deadpool #11, Kelly and McGuinness sent Wade and Blind Al back in time to the events of a classic issue of Spider-Man, a premise that was as insane and hilarious as it sounds. And in Deadpool & Death Annual 1998, we got one of Deadpool's greatest relationships: with Death herself (no relation to the young Goth version seen in Neil Gaiman's Sandman). 

In the comics, Deadpool is pansexual, so be prepared to see him flirt with anyone and everyone.

You can read all of Kelly's era in the Deadpool Omnibus. You can also get some of his best arcs in Deadpool Classic Volumes 3, 4, and 5. 

Who's that Cable guy everyone is talking about?

If you stuck around for the post-credits scene in Deadpool -- minor spoiler alert -- you heard our hero promise there will be a sequel, and it will feature the as-yet uncast Cable. 

Cable's origin story is one of the most complicated and ridiculous in all of comics history, involving clones and time-travel. But when Deadpool meets him, he's a militaristic, futuristic, and very serious X-man hero. Which is why the buddy comedy series of Cable & Deadpool in '04 by Fabian Nicieza was so perfect.

Be sure to check out the entire 50 issue run (divided into three volumes) before the next Deadpool movie comes out, or at the very least the first arc ""If Looks Could Kill.""

Deadpool Corps and beyond

 The last few years have seen Deadpool everywhere. The Deadpool Corps series introduced alternate-reality Deadpools as well as Lady Deadpool, Headpool, and various other meta off-shoots. 

More importantly, it saw the latest Deadpool monthly series by comedians Gerry Duggan and Brian Posehn. If you're looking for comics that go beyond the references in the movie, and for recent issues that will help you get into the Marvel canon, be sure to check out Duggan and Posehn's hilarious two-volume run. 

Which includes Deadpool fighting zombie presidents, naturally. 

Considering how much money the movie made over the weekend, this franchise isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Better get reading.

Researchers at the Optical Network Group at University College London published a study saying they have achieved a data transmission rate of 1.125 terabits per second, which is an absolutely insane amount of data. It also happens break the record for highest rate of data received by a single receiver. 

Senior research associate Robert Maher told Mashable in an email that this transmission rate could send/receive the entire Game of Thrones TV series in less than a second.

“The entire five-season box set has a file size of 120 GB in HD,” Maher said. “As there are eight bits in a byte, you could transmit/receive this box set in just one second if the download rate was 960 Gbps.”

To compare, Maher said state-of-the-art commercial systems can usually receive rates around 100 Gbps, whereas the average broadband rate in the U.S. is 11.7 Mbps, according to Akamai’s State of the Internet Report. The UCL team’s record is over 100,000 times faster than the rate of your average broadband connection.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to go out and buy a 1.125 Tbps router anytime soon -- the data was sent directly between the transmitter and receiver, so there's no long-range option at this time.

The team achieved the record by combining 15 lower-rate transmitters into a single super channel.

“This super channel is then routed as a single entity,” Maher said. “However, at the receiver, we detect the entire super channel in one go. Using this very high bandwidth receiver, we can record greater amounts of information.”

The team’s work was the result of a five-year collaborative project.

"56c4d32012d2cd1d1a0000ec","Miriam Kramer","World","Ancient light from the dawn of the universe has illuminated a 300,000 light-year-long jet shooting from a supermassive black hole. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the supermassive black hole jet in a system known as B3 0727+409. Light from the jet was sent out when the universe -- which is currently about 13.8 billion years old -- was 2.7 billion years old, NASA said.The study's authors think the jet in B3 0727+409 is boosting the signal from the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) -- a literal glow of light left over from the Big Bang -- allowing Chandra to catch sight of the distant object. SEE ALSO: Listen to two black holes colliding in deep space""Most people think of black holes as exotic objects that 'suck in' all of the matter around them, and from which nothing, not even light, can escape,"" Aurora Simionescu, co-author of a new study detailing the Chandra discovery, said in a blog post. ""While this it is true that, once anything has fallen in 'over the edge' or so called 'event horizon' of the black hole, it can never leave it again, a lot of interesting physics happens right before matter gets swallowed forever.""It's possible that the particles in the black hole jet slam into microwave photons in the CMB, exciting them and ""boosting"" their energy up to the point where they glow in X-ray, NASA said. The origins of the jets are mysterious, but Simionescu added that some material that is about to fall into the black hole may be ""accelerated"" to great speeds and pushed away from the black hole, forming the jets.           ""Nobody understands the exact details of how this happens, but probably through a twisted geometry of the magnetic fields, some of the material swirling around just on the verge of falling into the black hole is sometimes accelerated in really energetic jets moving away from the black hole instead,"" Simionescu wrote.What exactly the jets are is still a mystery to scientists, as is how some jets are able to emit X-rays.Astronomers have studied plenty of jets from black holes in the nearby universe, but the jet in the B3 0727+409 is one of only a few X-ray-emitting jets seen in the far-off cosmos, Simionescu said.In astronomy, space and time are related. The light from an object in the distant universe like the black hole jet in B3 0727+409 took billions of years to reach Chandra's detectors, giving scientists some insight into what the strange jet looked like in X-ray wavelengths long ago, when the CMB was more intense.Usually, these objects are observed using radio wavelengths of light, which are far from X-rays on the spectrum of light, and according to Simionescu, the jet in this particular system seems to have very little signal in radio wavelengths.This new finding could have far-reaching implications for how scientists study black hole jets in the future as well.""If bright X-ray jets can exist with very faint or undetected radio counterparts,"" co-author Lukasz Stawarz said in a statement, ""it means that there could be many more of them out there because we haven’t been systematically looking for them.""Have something to add to this story?

The first new variety comes with dark chocolate chips, crunchy biscuit and fudge pieces; and the second has caramelised hazelnuts and raspberry pieces. And, just to shake things up a bit, the ingredients sit on top of the chocolate bar, rather than hidden inside. 

What's more: the bar comes in a new shape, with extra-large squares; which could make your virtuous one-square rule slightly more calorific.

Hours after posting the original message proposing the billion-dollar investment, Kanye followed up with a new, more earnest plea.

""Mark Zuckerberg I know it’s your birthday but can you please call me by tomorrow,"" the multiple tweet message begins. ""You love hip-hop, you love my art… I am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house.""

Aside from getting Zuckerberg's birthday wrong (most records show that it's May 14), the message soon takes a turn for the desperate by attempting to employ the public's help. 

""World, please tweet, FaceTime, Facebook, Instagram, whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me,"" writes Kanye. ""I don’t have enough resources to create what I really can… Mark, I am publicly asking you for help… one of the coolest things you could ever do is to help me in my time of need… and I will always respect you for that and the world will love you…""

Professing love. Okay then. 

But here's the thing about Kanye and Facebook: He actually knows Zuckerberg (sort of). Back in 2010, the artist performed at the offices of Facebook in California. So if you were thinking Kanye was simply tossing out a big ask of someone he's never met, you would be wrong. This is very real, and possibly very personal. 

But it doesn't end there. Kanye then adds Google co-founder Larry Page to the mix in a series of tweets directed at Silicon Valley in general. 

""Hey Larry Page I’m down for your help too,"" writes Kanye. ""All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes but never help the real artists… you’d rather open up one school in Africa like you really helped the country… if you want to help… help me… I promise I’m going to make the world dope…. all I do is make shit dope #facts… All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help.""

hey Larry Page I’m down for your help too …— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 15, 2016

What began as a swaggering, random suggestion has now turned into what sounds like a very real, urgent appeal. We're not used to seeing the usually cocky rap artist resort to such a low bar as to play the cultural guilt card to solicit help. 

But if this isn't all some elaborate performance art on Kanye's part, then it may be time to take the artist's debt talk seriously. The House of West may indeed be in peril. 

For what it's worth, while all this was going on, his wife, Kim Kardashian, was still on her currency-generating grind on Twitter.

On average, two children drown every day in the Mediterranean while trying to reach safety in Europe, according to a report from UNHCR, UNICEF and the IOM released on Friday. During the first six weeks of 2016, 410 people drowned on this route -- a figure 35 times higher than those reported at this time last year.

""We cannot turn our faces away from the tragedy of so many innocent young lives and futures lost -- or fail to address the dangers so many more children are facing,"" UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in a statement.

Children make up more than one third of the total number of migrants and refugees making the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean Sea. The European Union has focused in on stemming the flow of migrants and refugees into the continent, but has yet to launch a comprehensive search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean. 

Much of the lifesaving work has fallen on the shoulders of volunteers and ad-hoc measures by the local coast guards. The EU a will hold a summit with the Turkish government in early March to implement a €3 billion joint action plan. 

But the aid groups behind the report believe the EU is failing to address the crisis head on.

""We may not have the ability now to end the desperation that causes so many people to try to cross the sea, but countries can and must cooperate to make such dangerous journeys safer,"" Lake said. ""No one puts a child in a boat if a safer option is available.""

In September 2015, images of the lifeless body of Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi lying facedown on a Turkish beach drew outrage from people across the world. At the time, promises were made and leaders around the world vowed to confront the growing issue.

But little has changed in the five months since his death. In fact, things have gotten worse.

Since that time, more than 340 children, many of them babies and toddlers, have drowned in the eastern Mediterranean while taking a similar route that Kurdi's family attempted. The total numbers death could be much greater, as many are lost at sea, and their bodies are never recovered.

Late last year, so many bodies were washing up weekly on the shores of the small Greek island of Lesbos that the cemeteries on the island were running out of space. 

The winter months have made the crossing increasingly dangerous, bringing low temperatures and rough seas that batter the rickety and overcrowded boats that set out from Turkey.

""These tragic deaths in the Mediterranean are unbearable and must stop,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said. ""Clearly, more efforts are needed to combat smuggling and trafficking. Also, as many of the children and adults who have died were trying to join relatives in Europe, organising ways for people to travel legally and safely, through resettlement and family reunion programmes for example, should be an absolute priority if we want to reduce the death toll.""

Described as ""a shovel with a string on it and an active EMG [pickup],"" this DIY guitar made from a household gardening tool belongs to musician Rob Scallon. The music video tells the age-old tale of a man who decides he'd rather use his shovel for rocking out instead of shoveling. 

According to Scallon, the shovel guitar itself was made by ""Rob"" from the channel I Like to Make Stuff, who will be posting a how-to guide very soon for any prospective shovel rockers.This panda just doesn't want to share its yummy snackAustralian man may have just recorded the world's loudest burpAn emotional high school graduation scene comes to life on the humble chalkboardSunny Leone and Alok Nath come together for a short film on no smoking",0.040952380952381,0.454285714285714,"http://mashable.com/2016/02/22/shovel-guitar/",154,13,98,0,8,8,1,"2016-02-22T23:13:41+00:00",1100,1,"Dude created a guitar out of a shovel and it's seriously metal",-0.333333333333333,0.666666666666667,"guitar, heavy metal, Video, Videos, viral video, Watercooler","hot"

Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, shared the figure during the latest episode of John Gruber's podcast, The Talk Show.

Gruber was joined by Cue and Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering. The three had a wide-ranging discussion about a variety of topics surrounding Apple and its software and services.

At the around the 46-minute mark, Cue revealed that Apple Music had passed 11 million subscribers. This news comes almost exactly a month after Apple confirmed it had passed 10 million paying subscribers. Spotify has about 25 million subscribers.

This is impressive when you consider that Apple Music formally launched at the end of June alongside a three-month free trial.

A big part of the push seems to be international. Cue was recently in China for the launch of Apple Music there, and on The Talk Show, Cue mentioned the service has come to Taiwan and Turkey in the last week.

Apple Music came to Android in November and the company has continued to update and improve its app for Android users.
